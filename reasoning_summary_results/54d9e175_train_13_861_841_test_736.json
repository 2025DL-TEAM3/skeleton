It seems each quadrant will have distinct colors that are summed or determined in some way from the non-zero input values. For example, in the top left quadrant, with inputs of {5,5}, {5,1}, and {5,5}, the distinct values are {1,5}, mapping to color 6. This pattern seems to apply to the other quadrants too, showing a consistent method for determining their output colors.**Mapping quadrant colors**\n\nThe bottom left (BL) and bottom right (BR) quadrants are both mapped to color 8 from the distinct values {3,5}. It seems that each half of the grid, like top and bottom, has identical sets leading to the same mapping. For instance, in the top left (TL) quadrant, distinct values of {1,5} led to mapping color 6, while the top right (TR) used distinct values {4,5}, mapping to color 9. It\u2019s interesting to note that mappings can differ between examples, even if the signature remains the same. Let\u2019s compute further to clarify!",
