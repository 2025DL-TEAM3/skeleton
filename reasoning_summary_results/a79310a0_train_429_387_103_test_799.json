They fill these layers with numbers, yielding only 1s and 2s, indicating a max distance of likely 2. In the first example, it seems the zeros form an irregular shape, with specific corner positions. I need to list these positions based on the row data to confirm their arrangement before deducing more about the distances involved.**Analyzing interior connectivity**\n\nI think we're exploring the connectivity of the interior and computing a distance transform. In the first example, I see the original 8x8 structure and how zeros plot out in various coordinates. There are zeros forming in specific rows, and I should compute the distance from each zero to the nearest one. The outputs label these positions as either 1 or 2 depending on their adjacency to ones in the input. However, there seems to be confusion about how boundaries are defined. I need to clarify that further by reviewing the next example.**Examining cluster mapping**\n\nI'm analyzing secondary clusters and their outputs. For instance, it seems the outputs for coordinates indicate relationships that might not align perfectly with the expected values. When looking at the thickness and borders of the clusters, I suspect the way they define borders may differ. The outer layer should be a background color, while interiors get a specific fill. However, it looks like they might be disregarding the interior/border distinction. Each blob might just be filled with a uniform color. I'll need to clarify this by checking smaller blobs to confirm their treatments.",
