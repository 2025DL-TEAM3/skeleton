    "reasoning": "**Examining array transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing a transformation between input and output arrays. The input has 6 rows and 9 columns, while the output shows certain changes in specific columns. For instance, in the first row, positions 2, 3, and 4 change from 0 to 1. It looks like I need to inspect each row to identify which columns specifically are altered. Rows 1 and 2 follow a similar pattern where those central columns change, while others remain the same. It's intriguing to trace these shifts!**Analyzing column changes**\n\nI'm digging into how certain columns in my input transform based on the output. For example, in the input of 0,0,0,0,0,6,6,6,0, we see that columns 2, 3, and 4 change from 0s to 1s. In another row, input 0,2,2,0,0,0,2,0,4 shows similar changes in columns 3, 4, and 5. This inconsistency in which columns shift makes me reconsider; are they actually diagonal or part of a different pattern? There seems to be a visual element to these changes.**Mapping number transformations**\n\nI'm working on visualizing changes in an output grid by marking where the 1s appear with Xs. Analyzing several rows shows that certain columns change from 0s to 1s in specific patterns. I\u2019ve identified blocks of rows and columns where these changes happen, which may relate to underlying patterns of 6s. It seems I should explore larger regions of zeros enclosed by non-zeros and maybe fill those. The idea is to define rules that determine how and where zeros are transformed into ones within the grid.**Finding rectangle dimensions**\n\nI'm exploring how to identify maximal pure zero rectangles in a grid. The idea is to require both dimensions to be at least 3 to qualify, which helps narrow down the candidates. For each rectangle, I'll determine its size and see if they can be filled according to the rules. I need to evaluate the potential rectangles\u2019 areas and ensure I fill only those that meet the criteria, keeping other cells unchanged in the process. This approach feels methodical and allows for clarity.",
