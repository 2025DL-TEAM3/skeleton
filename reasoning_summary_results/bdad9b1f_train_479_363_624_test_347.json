First, I need to identify the vertical bar of 2s, which means locating the column of original contiguous 2s. Once that\u2019s done, I'll draw horizontal bars that extend across the full width, replacing the background 8s with D. The vertical bar will stretch across every row, marking the intersections with a 4. Non-bar areas will stay original. It\u2019s a methodical approach to ensure clarity!**Analyzing grid bars**\n\nIn rows 0-4, there's no horizontal bar present, so I'll keep all the cells unchanged except for column 3, which should feature a 2. In row 5, it has a horizontal bar, so I find that the value is 9, making all of row 5 equal to 9, except for column 3 where I place a 4 at the intersection, resulting in 999499999. Row 6 remains unchanged since it's all 1s, giving me 111211111. \n\nIn the example grid, I see two groups of 9s, with one horizontal bar in row 2 and a vertical column of 9s in column 4 across the first two rows. I've verified the positions and confirmed that the D value is indeed 9 for both bars.**Identifying grid colors and bars**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the grid based on the background color and where the bars are located. In the example, the background color is 2, which appears most frequently. I see two bars of color 6: one horizontal bar of length 2 in row 2 and one vertical bar of length 3 in column 1. I'll replace all relevant cells with their respective colors and handle intersections by marking them with 4. The output grid will retain the background color in the non-bar areas and correctly depict the two bars. \n\nNow, I\u2019ll proceed to fill in these details properly across the grid based on my findings!**Constructing the grid output**\n\nI'm analyzing row 2, where I see a horizontal bar of color 6 starting at columns 3 and 4. However, column 1 has an isolated 6, which I need to remember. The horizontal bar will fill row 2 with 6s except for the intersection at row 2, column 1, which I'll mark as 4. The vertical bar will fill column 1 with 6s as well, but I'll also ensure to place 4 at the intersection. \n\nAfter setting everything up, I\u2019ll finalize the output grid, confirming that it aligns with the input. The output is:\n\n26222  \n26222  \n64666  \n26222",
