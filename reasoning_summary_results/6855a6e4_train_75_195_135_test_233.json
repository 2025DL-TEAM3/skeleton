    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input and output shifts**\n\nI\u2019m comparing the input and output lists, noticing there\u2019s a rotation going on. The first input row, \"2220202,\" becomes the fifth output row, while the second input row, \"2222222,\" appears twice in the output. Interestingly, the third row, \"4444444,\" stays the same, suggesting some rows are shifting up or down. It seems the output retains part of the original sequence but rearranges specific elements in a way that\u2019s tricky to pin down. What an interesting pattern!**Examining row mappings**\n\nI'm examining how the input rows map to the output. It seems that row i0 \"2220202\" goes to output row o4, while i9 \"2020002\" shifts to o5. This suggests a central symmetry around rows 4 and 5, but they actually change as well, so it's not a perfect mirror. Listing them out helps clarify the patterns, especially with unique inputs like i0, i2, and i3. I also notice potential shifts and mappings that lead to interesting reflections in the data arrangement!**Analyzing row positioning**\n\nI see that \"4222224\" appears in both o3 and o6, indicating it's part of the symmetric arrangement. The rows \"2222222\" dominate the other positions, while unique inputs like i0 and i9 shift to central positions o4 and o5. This suggests a pattern where unique rows move inward, potentially forming a \"donut\" shape. The input structure seems to create symmetry, especially with zeros. The anomalies are pulled towards the center but remain unchanged vertically. I\u2019ll continue to explore how these movements interact in different examples!",
