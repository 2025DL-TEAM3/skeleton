    "reasoning": "**Analyzing mirrored patterns**\n\nI'm noticing a mirrored pattern in the input and output sequences. For instance, in the first row, the input [2,6,6,6,6,6,8] transforms to [2,2,2,5,8,8,8]. Here, the single 2 becomes three 2s, and the 8 becomes three 8s. The 6s are replaced based on surrounding values. This pattern holds for other rows too. It seems the rows either retain the 6s or change based on new endpoints created by surrounding numbers, which appear symmetric.**Understanding transformation rules**\n\nI'm analyzing the transformation of rows with non-background values, where the background is represented by 6. It seems that for each row, the cells connect two colored values with an intermediate value of 5 at the midpoint. For instance, in row 1, the left endpoint is 2 and the right is 8, with the midpoint calculated as 3, which receives a 5. Filling occurs based on these endpoints. This rule applies similarly in other rows, calculating the midpoint and filling the left and right regions accordingly.**Exploring transformation rules further**\n\nI'm working through the transformation rules for this grid. In some rows, only those with exactly two non-background cells, or endpoints, change. For example, row0 has multiple non-background values, so it doesn't qualify for transformation. Similarly, row8 has too many non-background cells, so it stays unchanged too. Rows filled with the background color remain unaltered. Rows one through seven are all background colors, so they stay as they are. Thus, the output matches the input for the specified rows. It seems the rules are focused on those precise endpoints.**Finalizing transformation logic**\n\nI'm exploring how to apply transformations to both columns and rows. While most ARC puzzles usually work horizontally, this test input appears transposed with vertical endpoints. It seems the transformations can apply to any direction, detecting linear segments at the extremes. For the central column, since both endpoints are background, it remains unchanged. Checking the central row reveals a consistent line of 5s, fitting the pattern perfectly. So, the final output grid reflects this transformation accurately. I feel confident providing that!",
