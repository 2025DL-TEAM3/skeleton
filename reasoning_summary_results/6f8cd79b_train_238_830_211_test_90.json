    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the puzzle**\n\nI see this puzzle mimics an ARC-like format with three examples, showing input and output grids with numbers. The first task is identifying the rule used to transform the input. I've observed that the borders of the output are consistently filled with 8's, while the interior digits appear to be retained or modified based on connectivity. For example, looking at the second row, the edges converted to 8's, while the middle numbers seem unchanged. I\u2019ll dig deeper into this pattern.**Clarifying the rules**\n\nIn analyzing the examples, I recognize a consistent pattern where all border cells are replaced by 8's. In the first example, the interior digits remain unchanged except for those connected to the border. In looking at the second and third examples, the rules hold: borders always turn to 8's while interior values stay the same or only reflect the necessary adjustments. It\u2019s clear that the method is to create a frame of 8's around the grid, which simplifies the transformation process.**Finalizing the grid output**\n\nI\u2019ve got the columns sorted out: for row 2, the interior numbers come out as 6, 6, 9, 9, 9, 6, 6, which confirms the final output. Row 3's input interior checks out too, providing consistent results. I confirmed the zero in column 1 correctly turns to 8 in the output. All examples align perfectly, so I\u2019m confident the completed grid looks like this:  \n\n888888888  \n866999668  \n844464648  \n888888888  \n\nIt\u2019s essential to maintain clarity, ensuring each row stands alone.",
