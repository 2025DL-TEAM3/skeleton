    "reasoning": "**Considering adjacency rules**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out which 8 is adjacent to a 3 and what those neighbors are. For example, the cell at row 2, column 4 is adjacent to the cell above it and to the left, both containing 3. Similarly, the cell at row 3, column 4 has a 3 to the left and an 8 above. I\u2019m questioning diagonal adjacency; for instance, does row 2, column 4 diagonally connect to row 1, column 3? This could complicate things further.**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nI\u2019m pondering how 8s and 9s in the input grid transform into the output. It seems all 8s turn into 2s, while 9s stay the same\u2014which makes sense. For instance, in the first example, 8s in the input row become 2s in the output, leaving 9s unchanged. However, it looks like not every 8 turns into a 2 in the first example, which complicates things. \n\nNow, in the next example, the digits 4 and 0 appear. It\u2019s intriguing that some 4s seem to become 2s in the output. I'm considering how those replacements work in their respective positions too.**Exploring grid transformation rules**\n\nI'm considering how to fill background cells in the grid when dealing with shapes. For example, when I have an area with 4 shape cells and some background cells, the background should be filled with a designated color, which is 2 in this case. The bounding box determines where to fill. In the latest case, I see zeros and fours. The less frequent color, which is the shape, is four, while the background is zeros. \n\nI\u2019ll need to fill those background cells with 2 to maintain consistency.**Mapping the shape grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the shape and background cells in the grid. Specifically, I see that rows 5 to 8 have several 4s, which make up the shape, while the zeros act as the background. \n\nAfter defining the bounding box from row 5 to 8 and columns 1 to 4, I\u2019ll need to replace any background zeros within this bounding area with 2, leaving other values unchanged. In the final output, the modified rows 5 to 8 reflect these changes, while rows 1 to 4 and 9 to 10 remain untouched.",
