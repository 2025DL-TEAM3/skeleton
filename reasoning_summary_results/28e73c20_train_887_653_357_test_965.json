It seems like digits represent colors in a grid format and I need to figure out the transformation rules. For instance, I have an input grid that I can align with an output grid. It looks like the output digits are possibly counting specific elements or measuring some kind of distance. There\u2019s definitely a pattern to decode here. Let's carefully analyze the examples for more clues!**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nI'm checking the mapping from input to output grids, focusing on the positions of zeros. It seems the input's zeros relate to output's numbers, but there's more to explore. For instance, in a new example, I see how the output numbers and their respective positions might reflect counts or neighboring elements. It looks like the largest shapes are highlighted based on vertical segments, particularly the digit '8'. I need to further examine these relationships to confirm the transformation rules!**Exploring grid preservation**\n\nI'm analyzing how certain elements in the grid are preserved in the output. It seems they keep cells that are part of runs\u2014like vertical or horizontal segments of connected values. For instance, in one example, the preserved cells in column 2 show a pattern where adjacent similar values are retained. It appears the output has a symmetric pattern with borders of '3s', and perhaps the underlying rule is to maintain a central symmetry within these connected segments. I need to dig deeper for clarity!",
