The output grids keep the same dimensions, and it seems like each cell could be replaced by the most frequent value in its row. \n\nIn the first example, the input grid has 6 rows and 6 columns, where the first three rows become 444444, and the last three become 555555. It looks like each row is being replaced based on the majority value of the entries. I'll confirm my approach by checking how the mapping process works!**Identifying row patterns**\n\nI'm looking at example two again. It seems like the input row changes from 4 to 5 in the output, resulting in 115555 for all rows rather than being consistent with the fill-each-row rule. \n\nIt raises the question of what common patterns could exist across examples. I notice all outputs have uniform blocks, with duplicates present. In the first example, the majority digit determines the output. For example, if the majority is 4 or 5, they fill with that uniform row. I will note that!**Determining the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the second row and sixth row, noting that the most frequent row seems to be 1114466. So, I\u2019ll set that as the template and produce an output grid of 9 rows, all showing 1114466.\n\nThis approach matches the pattern we've seen where a uniform output is created when just one class exists. I must also briefly consider if each row should be filled with its majority digit, but it looks like the expected answer is to repeat 1114466. I think this is the correct final output!",
