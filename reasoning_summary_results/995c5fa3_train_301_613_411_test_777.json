My thought process is leading to visualizing the arrangements in a grid format, possibly reflecting color transitions. I'll dive a bit deeper into that!**Analyzing Color Patterns**\n\nI\u2019m exploring how the outputs correspond to color occurrence patterns, focusing on how often the minority color appears. In the first example, I analyze the grids systematically, detailing counts for each row.  \n\nFor example, in Row 1 with \"222237777\", there are four 2s, one 3, and four 7s. In Row 2, I see that it\u2019s predominantly 2s and 3s again. I notice a consistent balance in counts across colors, leading me to ponder if the outputs represent the relationships among colors, possibly focusing on how they're arranged spatially. I think there's something deeper about how connectivity among colors shapes the output.**Understanding Color Mapping**\n\nI'm analyzing how the outputs reflect the colors in the input. It seems that the left outer color corresponds to 2, while the right corresponds to 7. The challenge is to understand how these colors translate into the output, which appears as a 2x2 grid. \n\nIn this grid, the output seems to indicate specific counts based on the colors present and their arrangement. I suspect the output numbers represent connected components of the colors rather than individual pixel counts. As I explore this, I notice a pattern suggesting that the appearances of the colors are always consistent in their shape, and I\u2019m determining how this shapes the task.",
