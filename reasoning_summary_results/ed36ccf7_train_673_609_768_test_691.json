    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC Task Puzzle**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a puzzle involving input-output pairs to find a rule. I see that the first example inputs a single row of \"222,\" producing a column output of three \"2\"s. The second example has two rows with the digits \"8919893\" and \"9969029,\" leading to seven lines in the output. This suggests a grid of 2x7 for input and a transpose resulting in 7x2 for output. There seems to be a function applied to the corresponding pairs in these positions.**Testing Transformations and Axes Swapping**\n\nI'm exploring a transformation process involving swapping axes in a 2D representation of input data. For example, the second sample involves taking a 2x7 grid, transposing it to 7x2, and then applying a function to each element post-transposition. I can verify this process by checking the new arrangement of values after reversing the rows. It turns out that the output is a vertically flipped version of the transposed input grid. I\u2019ll keep validating with the other examples to ensure consistency!**Determining Output Transformations**\n\nI'm testing transformations with an example input to understand how the output is generated. I start by transposing the input matrix and looking for patterns in the output. Each output row appears to match the transposed rows, but in reverse order, suggesting a vertical reflection of the transposed matrix. By verifying this with more examples, including the input provided, I can systematically derive the output rows. Ultimately, the transformation seems to be a combination of transposition and vertical flipping of rows.**Defining Matrix Transformations**\n\nI\u2019m laying out the input matrix M and defining its structure. I find the columns and construct the transposed matrix T correctly by pulling entries from each column of M. Then, I reverse the order of T\u2019s rows to create the output grid N. The output consists of six rows, directly matching my expectations based on determined dimensions. I double-check to ensure the output aligns with other examples, confirming that everything looks good. Finally, I present the resulting rows clearly.",
    "test_output_text": "79099975\n95797999\n96289990\n79922969\n89979976\n58699999\n",
    "correct": true
