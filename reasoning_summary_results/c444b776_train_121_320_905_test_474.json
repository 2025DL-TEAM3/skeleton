    "reasoning": "**Analyzing patterns in rows**\n\nI'm working on figuring out how to create symmetry in a pattern of numbers. Looking at the example, I see three rows with a clear structure. The input has the first digit consistently as '2', while the last digits change, which creates a mirroring effect in the output. It seems they modify those trailing numbers, maybe shifting values to create that symmetry. I'm exploring whether there's a reflection or other diagonal pattern involved. It\u2019s interesting to see how these changes affect the overall structure.**Identifying output patterns**\n\nIn the first row, I see the input sequence is 2-5-1-2-2 and the output changes only the last digit, making it 2-5-1-2-5. This pattern seems to come from the second position of the input. For subsequent rows, the last digit of each row's output mirrors that second input digit. \n\nMoving on to another example, the output duplicates the first three rows cyclically for the next four. It feels like a rule emerges: later rows are just cycles of initial patterns. I\u2019m pinpointing how these transformations happen.**Examining row patterns**\n\nIn analyzing the rows, I notice a clear structure in how outputs are derived from inputs. The 5th row, which contains 000, acts as a separator, clearly dividing the upper and lower halves of the grid. The rows above and below this separator mirror each other, maintaining their sequences. \n\nIn another example, there are distinct rows that could serve as separators, which leads to a repeating pattern throughout the output. This creates cycles that extend beyond the initial input, suggesting a transformation rather than a straightforward copy. However, in one case, certain rows do get modified, indicating a more nuanced pattern.**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI'm exploring the grid structures of different examples, focusing on how background colors and patterns interact. Initially, it seems that the background color is defined by frequency, but the process involves identifying and replacing background areas with specific shapes from non-background colors. \n\nI realize that each example reveals patterns of variation in rows, which influences how we tile these shapes across the grid. Ultimately, it seems like the method is to repeat the identified pattern across the entire grid while considering variations, leading to a final output that preserves these relationships. This approach feels convincing!",
