That matches the last three columns of the third row, which is also 9, 8, 7, 1, 7, 8, 7. So, it seems I\u2019m looking for overlapping patterns in the input. I\u2019m considering symmetrical patterns or repeated quadrants, particularly in the 5x7 input, where I can find the smallest repeating tile. Let\u2019s check the 5x5 input as well!**Examining tiling patterns**\n\nI'm looking into whether a 2x2 pattern can tile a 5x5 grid. Starting with the 2x2 tile in the top-left, I need to see if it can fill the area. For input2, there seems to be symmetry across both the central row and column, suggesting a pattern involving reversal.\n\nI\u2019ll outline the numbers visually to find repeating blocks, like the 2x2 block of [4,0;2,8], which repeats in certain positions. I notice similarities across rows, noting that the goal might be to extract that core block shape, paying attention to how patterns can overlap.**Exploring block selection rules**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand if blocks consisting of '1's only are treated as background, which would limit selection to non-background blocks. In examples, several unique substrings exist, but it seems like the chosen blocks are the ones that aren\u2019t purely background. \n\nIn example1, while many unique 3x2 blocks appear, they picked one that matches the orientation of the repeated pattern. Perhaps the rule is to favor blocks without background colors, leading to selecting those that appear less frequently or align with a central motif. They seem to focus on periodicity, aiming for blocks that can reconstruct the input through repetition.",
