This gives me three blocks in total from the arrangement. I wonder about vertical stripes as I analyze the columns. \n\nIt seems like the only full rows of nines appear horizontally, as no columns are entirely filled with 9s. I'm considering how output columns might be decided based on these horizontal stripes. It looks like horizontal segmentation is key for determining the structure here.**Analyzing potential stripes and blocks**\n\nI'm considering stripes in the input data, noticing that most elements are 6s with some 4s present, especially in certain columns. Rows 2 and 5 are unique, being filled with 9s. \n\nI see that column 3 always contains 9s across multiple rows, which suggests a possible vertical stripe there. It seems this vertical structure divides the arrangement into blocks, explaining why the output width is only 2. I'm wondering if any other columns present similar uniformity or patterns.**Determining symmetry and majority values**\n\nI'm analyzing symmetry in rectangular blocks, specifically focusing on blocks (0,1) and (1,0). I've found that block (0,1) has no symmetry based on my checks in both horizontal and vertical directions, leading me to identify the majority value as 7.\n\nFor block (1,0), I'm also examining rows, where I find that while some rows maintain vertical symmetry, others don\u2019t. After counting frequencies, it becomes clear that 7 is the majority value again. Therefore, my predicted output grid displays values as:\n\n17\n77 \n\nI believe this fits the expected format!",
