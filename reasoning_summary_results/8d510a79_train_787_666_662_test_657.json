    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation of coordinates**\n\nI'm looking at a transformation where some 7s convert to 1s to create a symmetric shape. Identifying coordinates of existing 1s is essential: (2,3), (6,1), (6,2), and (7,4). With the pattern emerging, it seems missing 1s are filled to complete the design. Additionally, I see that new coordinates for ones appear at (1,3), (7,1), and (7,2), leading to a total of 7 ones in the output. I'm curious about other examples and their patterns too!**Examining digit transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing some transformations with the digits 2, 9, 1, and zeros. The output has specific changes: in the first row, columns 2 and 3 shift from 0 to 2, while row 4's column 3 also changes. This leads to symmetric differences at various points. \n\nIn another example, I'm spotting changes from 6s and 5s to 2s, and it seems like they might be drawing a shape of connected 2s. Their distribution likely forms an hourglass shape, creating an interesting visual pattern!**Exploring segment extensions**\n\nI'm examining how certain digits are being extended in segments. For the 2s in example 3, they don't fill every adjacent space, focusing instead on specific blocks. The original 2s form vertical segments, with some gaps between. \n\nWhen checking the output, I see that certain positions are filled while others remain unchanged. They essentially extend segments outward, but only to specific adjacent positions rather than filling all spaces. It seems like there\u2019s a pattern based on proximity to existing 2s, which mirrors behavior from previous examples with segments!",
