    "reasoning": "**Analyzing mirroring patterns**\n\nI\u2019m checking an example with a 9x9 input, focusing on regions of 3s and specific columns with 5s. The notable positions include two cells with 5s in the second row and one in the third. The arrangement of 5s appears to create an inverted V shape, and there's a pattern symmetry in the output. The resulting 4x6 shape mirrors a repetitive structure, alternating between blocks of 5s and 3s. This symmetry reflects the original input's layout.**Exploring grid scaling**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a grid pattern based on the input shape. I see a V shape with 5s at specific positions, but the output should feature multiple V shapes, which might not be correct. In a different example, a 6x3 grid shows two blocks with a distinct pattern: the upper block being solid threes, while the lower consists of fours. I\u2019m realizing the output fills the shape with the majority color. The idea seems to expand irregular regions into a symmetric pattern by scaling, so each cell doubles into a 2x2 block, but the output ratio is puzzling.**Analyzing grid scaling and cropping**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating the input grid colors where 7 appears to be the background and 6 the special color. After counting the occurrences, I see that the first five rows contain 6, while the last four rows can be removed since they only have 7. I also check column contents to determine which columns contain any 6s, keeping only those that do. The resulting cropped grid maintains the rows and columns, and then I can scale it into a larger output grid.**Duplicating and scaling rows**\n\nI\u2019m transforming each cropped row by duplicating each number into two columns and repeating the row twice. For instance, the first cropped row [7,7,6,6,7] becomes [7,7,7,7,6,6,6,6,7,7]. This pattern continues for each cropped row, leading to a structured output with ten rows. I ensure each row maintains proper formatting with no commas, while confirming consistency in my calculations. The final output compiles these transformed rows in an organized manner!",
