    "reasoning": "**Analyzing pixel data**\n\nI'm trying to determine the background color, which appears to be the most frequent, possibly 9. The non-background pixels seem to be 7, 6, and 2 in specific rows. I noted bounding box rows containing non-nines, specifically rows 2 through 9, which gives me eight rows. But there only seem to be four rows in the output. I wonder if the background could also include 7, although that feels less likely. Alternatively, could the shape color be the uncommon one? More investigation is needed!**Examining output differences**\n\nI noticed a discrepancy: input row 7 is 9299, but output row 2 shows 9297. That 7 might have come from row 2's column 4, which has 9997. Let's review the relevant rows 6-9.\n\nRow 6 matches. Row 7 has a difference in the last digit, while rows 8 and 9 match the outputs. It seems the last digit in row 7 likely came from row 2. They might be combining shapes here, particularly involving a 2 and a 7. \n\nI should map positions of the 2's to clarify this bounding box and see how the cropping works!**Analyzing cropping rules**\n\nIt seems they only keep three columns, possibly dropping ones that are uniform and contain only one value, like column 3 having all 7s. The remaining columns with more varied non-background values appear to be columns 4, 5, and 6, which they selected.\n\nHowever, I noticed a mismatch in the mappings. It\u2019s tricky\u2014perhaps they're summing values instead of selecting based on count. The goal could be to crop non-background colors dynamically to create rectangular sub-grids based on the most frequent colors. \n\nI need to rethink the definition of background and how it relates to the cropping process, especially what constitutes a background color!**Refining cropping rules**\n\nFor the current example, it looks like I need to crop based on whether the shape occupies the full extent of a dimension. If it spans all columns but not rows, I'll crop the rows, as seen with shape 7 which only fills row 5.\n\nIn another case, if the shape spans only partial columns and rows, I'll crop the dimension with the lesser span. I think the overall rule is to identify the non-background color with the largest connected component. \n\nThat helps clarify the process: capturing the bounding box dimensions and cropping accordingly. In this test, it\u2019s just one row yielding the output 77777777.",
