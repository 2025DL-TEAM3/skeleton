    "reasoning": "**Analyzing shapes in examples**\n\nOkay, I\u2019m looking at the first example with four non-background cells, potentially forming two shapes. The colors [8, 7, 4, 7] have the color 7 appearing twice. Those 7\u2019s at (2,7) and (3,6) are diagonal, possibly making a shape. I sorted the coordinates and see a 2x2 block pattern here.\n\nMoving to the second example, color 6 appears in positions of its own, creating two distinct 2x2 blocks. The changes in row 7 shift some colors to 3s. This is interesting!**Exploring shape extensions**\n\nI'm analyzing how blocks are extended downward, filling positions with color 3 instead of the original colors. The input blocks had color 6, and I see similarities in example 1, where colors 7 and 8 appear.\n\nIn example 1, they detected a footprint and filled below it up to a boundary. Example 3 shows color 2 and 8, revealing shapes, and it seems they create square-like blocks that expand downward dynamically. The filling pattern varies in row counts, forming interesting shapes and variations of colors above and below.**Understanding shape filling process**\n\nI'm exploring how shapes are filled downward in a grid. It seems they extend until reaching the same shape or another one, but in example 1, they just keep going down. The dimensions of the filled block are swapped from shape dimensions. So for example 1, the shape spans columns 5-7 with a width of 3 and height of 2, yet they fill a rectangle with rows 4-6 and columns 6-7.\n\nIn example 2, they fill identical patterns under the blocks. It\u2019s curious that while block height informs the row count, they only filled one row below, which is interesting!**Analyzing shape filling layers**\n\nWith example 2, I notice it's quite different because it has two shapes, yet it only fills one row instead of the expected two layers. In contrast, examples 1 and 3 fill according to the defined rules. The question arises about the anomaly in example 2; perhaps it fills only one layer because of the spacing and background colors involved.\n\nIn example 3, it appropriately fills two layers. Therefore, the most consistent approach moving forward is to treat shapes by filling transposed dimensions accurately, aligning with the previous examples. The final output grid reflects this thought.",
