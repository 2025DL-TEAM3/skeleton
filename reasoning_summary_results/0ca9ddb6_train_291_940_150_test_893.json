    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the output pattern**\n\nI've got an input of \"6 0 8 0 0 8 0 0\" resulting in \"6 0 8 0 4 8 4 0.\" So, it seems that 4s are added to columns 4 and 6 in certain rows, while row 3 and the first two rows remain unchanged. \n\nI'm hypothesizing that there's a pattern involving filling 2x2 blocks with 4s surrounding the existing 6s and 8s. It seems those additions are two columns to the right of non-zero digits in the original input. I'll need to verify this logic further.**Evaluating the output transformation**\n\nLooking at the input example \"000000600\" resulting in \"070000600,\" it seems that a 7 has been added to column 1 of row 0, while other non-zero values were preserved. \n\nIn row 1, additions make more sense: 7s are placed adjacent to existing 1s and 6s. Each row seems to fill left/right of non-zero digits with 7s. However, in row 0's case, the relationship to the 6 in column 6 is puzzling, as the 7 is far to the left. This pattern suggests mirroring based on position.**Understanding the pattern in examples**\n\nLet's analyze example 1 with a 5x8 input. The non-zero values showed 6s and 8s that might form diagonal or zigzag shapes on the grid. Notably, there's a diagonal from (0,4) to (4,0) consisting of 6s, and other vertical and horizontal lines around 2 and 8. \n\nThe additions of 4s in the output correlate to diagonal shifts from these important values, suggesting a pattern of placing colors based on their surrounding numbers. The alignment seems intentional, creating a mirrored effect based on the colors present in the input. I need to verify how this applies in other examples too.",
