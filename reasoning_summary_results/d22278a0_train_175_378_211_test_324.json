    "reasoning": "**Exploring propagation lines**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether there are two propagation lines from the seed located at (6,1). One might go left and the other right, filling up to a boundary. It\u2019s also possible I should connect these two seeds at (6,1) and (6,8), leading to paths that meet. I\u2019m identifying the positions of the 5s as well, like those in Row 2 and Row 4. Observing how these fit into my overall mapping is intriguing.**Analyzing propagation patterns**\n\nI'm exploring how the seeds propagate in a V shape. The 9s branch out left from (6,1) and the 5s spread out right from (6,8), both moving upward. It seems they alternate between diagonal movements and horizontal spreads. Notably, Row 3 has no 9s, likely creating symmetry, as its absence matches the pattern at the midline between Rows 3 and 4. The propagation looks reflective, with continued horizontal expansion forming a repeating and symmetrical structure as I go up the rows.**Refining mapping patterns**\n\nI'm realizing the mapping is quite messy, but I think using a pattern like Example 1 might help. I could normalize by dividing positions by 8 and multiplying by 6. Each position then maps proportionally, like rounding the adjusted values. \n\nI\u2019m considering the rows and columns but want to stick with the earlier approach, using original positions. Ultimately, I\u2019ll settle on a grid based on previous mappings, resulting in a final guess. The grid looks like this:\n\nRow1: 222222  \nRow2: 000888  \nRow3: 222222  \nRow4: 000088  \nRow5: 220822  \nRow6: 020828  \n\nThis seems to capture the complexities well!",
