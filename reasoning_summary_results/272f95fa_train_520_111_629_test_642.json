    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nThis puzzle appears to involve transformations in grids, specifically 7x7 and 9x9. In the first puzzle, there's a pattern with specific digits, primarily 7 and 9, where some 7s are replaced with digits like 2, 4, 6, and 3. The input consists of seven rows each containing seven digits, while the output modifies certain 7s. The second puzzle looks like a 9x9 grid but again, the actual rows vary. It\u2019s intriguing to observe how these digit patterns shift across different configurations!**Identifying grid transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing the dimensions of different grid examples here. The first puzzle is a 7x7 grid, while the second input seems to be a 10x9 layout, evident from counting the rows and columns. With the first example, when comparing input and output, only certain digits change, particularly the 7s. There\u2019s a consistent pattern where these transformations occur, specifically in symmetric positions. Rows one and two change to certain digits, guiding me to infer a transformation rule to understand these patterns better.**Examining row and column transformations**\n\nWhile analyzing the outputs, I noticed that rows four and five are identical, creating a clear pattern. It appears that segments of repeated rows are grouped, with specific separators in between. Each segment maintains a count but undergoes a transformation with changed digits. Notably, the transformations depend on the segment position. For example, segments can be evaluated based on vertical runs of numbers and how those are modified based on their length and position. I should further explore this vertical run approach for deeper insights!",
