For the special cell, I need to replace all cells to the right with a pattern that alternates between the cell's color and a new one. In example one, when the special cell is 6, the colors alternate between 5 and 6, starting with 5. Each row has its special cell affecting the pattern as we go right. It's a bit intricate, but I\u2019m aiming to get it right!**Identifying anomalies in color patterns**\n\nI\u2019m determining that the anomalies in each row are cells with the color 7 among mostly 8s. The new alternating pattern will use colors 5 and 7, filling to the right with 5 first, then 7, while keeping the special cell itself unchanged. For example, in Row 2 where the special cell is at column 1, the pattern fills columns 2-6 with [5, 7]. I\u2019m visualizing the rows and writing them out to confirm they match the expected results. Let's ensure it's clear and correct!",
