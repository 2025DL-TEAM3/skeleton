    "reasoning": "**Identifying the pattern in the puzzle**\n\nI'm looking at this puzzle where numbers change within a grid. It seems there's a transformation happening between the input and output of each line. For example, in the first row, the number '7' is changed to '5'. \n\nBy examining each row, I see that '7' consistently transforms into '5' across all rows. My observation leads me to conclude that the rule here is to replace every '7' with '5'. It's interesting to piece together these transformations!**Examining the digit mappings**\n\nI'm checking for changes in this next block, and it looks like the only modification is converting '7' to '5,' while other digits like '9,' '6,' and '2' remain unchanged. \n\nLooking closer, each row confirms this mapping: from the first row there\u2019s a consistent pattern where '7' translates to '5'. As I analyze further rows, the mapping remains firm, reinforcing that the only transformation is '7' to '5.' It\u2019s interesting to see this pattern emerge!**Verifying the digit transformations**\n\nLooking at my mappings, it appears that every '7' consistently changes to '5' while the other digits remain the same. In the final output of my test grid, I see rows transforming accordingly: 657 becomes 655, 769 turns into 569, and 765 becomes 565. \n\nI've confirmed that only '7' is affected, while '5,' '6,' and '9' stay unchanged. There aren't any tricky nuances to consider here, so the final output is simply:\n\n655  \n569  \n565",
