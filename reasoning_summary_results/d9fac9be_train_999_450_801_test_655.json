It looks like I should focus on counting occurrences to find the least common digit. \n\nAfter rough calculations, it seems that zeros occur the most, while ones are the least frequent. That makes sense for the output being 1, as it\u2019s the least common digit.**Exploring digit shapes in grids**\n\nI\u2019m considering how digits might correlate with colors in a pixel image, focusing on shape detection. Specifically, I want to count connected components associated with certain colors, then identify shapes with particular hole counts. Looking at digits like 0, 1, and 7, they form distinct shapes: 1 as a vertical line, 7 having a unique pattern, and 0 as a blob. \n\nI need to analyze a grid consisting of colored cells to find which color corresponds to specific properties. This might involve counting color regions, especially those with a specific configuration, like having an odd number of holes. I also plan to compute the connected components within this grid based on nearby pixels.",
