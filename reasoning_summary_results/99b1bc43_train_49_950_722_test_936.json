    "reasoning": "**Evaluating cell distances**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to compute distances from each cell in a region to the nearest occlusion of a specific color on the other side. Alternatively, I wonder if I could count contiguous cells from a bar until a different color appears. For example, in one case, with a bar at column 5 and the region in columns 1-4, each row would output four values, which seems consistent. I also need to clarify how rows map to outputs in other examples.**Mapping region outputs**\n\nI'm testing the mapping for the region above the bar, using input rows that should yield two outputs. It appears that the mapping for row 1 generates an output based on its input values: 000060000. For each column, applying a function gives alternating outputs \u2014 for instance, the series seems to alternate between 3 and 6. \n\nAlso, I'm considering whether the mapping might be related to counting non-zero entries in the column region instead of being location dependent. I'll need to investigate this systematically in the next example.**Analyzing pattern mapping**\n\nI'm considering the task of analyzing a 2x3 constrained grid problem based on the provided data. The region above the bar has its own pattern and the region below reflects that, suggesting a diagonal downwards left. \n\nI think I need to map input patterns to new codes while considering how previous examples behaved. For instance, in example two, numbers in the output often differ from the input colors. The key might be that less frequent colors are mapped to more frequent ones while introducing a new code like 3. I'll need to systematically apply this rule for the potential output.",
