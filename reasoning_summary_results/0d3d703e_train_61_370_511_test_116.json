If I shift the digits to the right by two positions, I get [2,2,2,6,6,6], which doesn\u2019t match the output. Shifting left yields [6,6,2,2,2,6], also incorrect. \n\nHmm, maybe the output is some kind of transformation or mapping of the digits? Exploring more patterns, I realize that the final rows follow a half 2s and half 6s structure. Could that be the key?**Understanding digit arrangements**\n\nI\u2019m exploring how the outputs relate to the input rows, which all seem to consist of three 6s and three 2s but arranged differently. \n\nIt looks like the output doesn\u2019t always arrange them in ascending order. For instance, the first row outputs 622266 instead of the fully sorted 222666. I wonder if shifting or counting runs of digits might reveal a pattern. \n\nFor example, row three successfully aligns when shifted, but rows one and two seem inconsistent. Maybe the method involves shifting based on contiguous counts instead?**Applying digit transformation**\n\nI'm mapping digits 1 to 5 and 8 to 9, then applying this transformation to a set of inputs. For the first row, \"8181881\" I get \"9595995\" after the transformation. \n\nSystematically applying this to all rows gives final outputs like \"9559599\" and \"5599999\". Double-checking my mapping confirms it's symmetric, so applying it twice should return the original digits. \n\nHere\u2019s the output grid:\n\n9595995  \n9559599  \n5599999  \n9959959  \n9559555  \n5559599  \n9559959  \n9959999  \n9599599",
