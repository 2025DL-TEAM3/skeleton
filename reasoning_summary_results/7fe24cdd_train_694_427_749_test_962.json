For the input pairs, it seems the outputs involve rotating and concatenating the digits in a specific way. \n\nThe first example uses a 2x2 grid, which yields a 4x4 output with a symmetrical pattern. Now, for my input of 334, 433, and 344, I need to identify how to rotate these numbers effectively to generate the right outputs. This is definitely an interesting challenge!**Understanding the rotational grid pattern**\n\nI'm examining an output grid generated from a 2x2 input grid, which reveals a fascinating toroidal cyclic pattern. Each quadrant of the output consists of a rotated version of the original input grid. For the grid created from input (7, 3) and (8, 3), the blocks in the 4x4 output show how rotation creates variations. \n\nMoving on to the next example, I find a similar method applies to a 3x3 input, leading to a 6x6 output pattern. This is a neat mathematical exploration!",
