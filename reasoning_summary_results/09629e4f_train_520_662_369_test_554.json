We can divide the 5x5 grid into quadrants after removing the central row and column. Each quadrant is determined by its positions: top-left (1-2, 1-2), top-right (1-2, 4-5), bottom-left (4-5, 1-2), and bottom-right (4-5, 4-5). In the top-left quadrant example, the majority value is 7, which appears most frequently.**Examining quadrant logic**\n\nI\u2019m tackling a puzzle with a 5x5 grid while keeping the central row and column fixed. For each of the four quadrants, if there's a majority value, I'll decide whether to fill with that majority or a minority value based on proximity to the center. In the top-left quadrant, for instance, I need to check which value is closer to the (2,2) seed cell. If it's the majority, I use that; otherwise, I will select the seed's value, but I need to be careful when picking between distinct minority values.**Deciphering quadrant filling rules**\n\nIn Q2 of the example, I noticed both values 2, 6, and 9 are present. There seems to be a choice based on the quadrant's second-most frequent value compared to a global one, which gets a bit tricky. For Q4, although 6 is the second-most value, it wasn\u2019t filled accordingly. An alternate approach is to choose the quadrant with the smallest difference in frequency of values. This leads to some decisions about which quadrant to fill, often based on proximity, symmetry, and patterns, revealing a potential symmetry in the outputs across both rows and columns.",
