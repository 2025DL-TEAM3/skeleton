    "reasoning": "**Counting non-2 digits**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing digit rows to count non-2s. For Row 1, digits 1, 3, and 1 count as three non-2 digits. In Row 2, only digits 3 and 1 are non-2, giving me two. Row 3 shows four digits: 2, 1, 3, and 1 as non-2, but I double-check that it totals to three. Row 4 has two non-2 digits: 3 and 1. I confirm the counts as 3, 2, 3, and 2 across rows 1 to 4, with 10 rows total.**Analyzing non-2 patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how many rows feature exactly two non-2 digits, specifically 3 and 1, in different positions. \n\nIn Row 5, I notice three non-2 digits appear in positions 3, 4, and 5, creating a shifted pattern similar to Row 1. Row 6 has two non-2 digits at positions 4 and 5, which is like Row 4's but shifted again. As I go through Row 7 and Row 8, similar patterns emerge.\n\nIt seems the extra rows are variations of the non-2 patterns 131 and 312, sliding through positions and alternating in a structured way. It all reveals a repetitive nature in the digits!**Examining row patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how certain patterns shift across rows. For Row 1, the pattern is 131 at offset 1, and for Row 2, it shows a 31 pattern at offset 2. This alternating pattern continues through the output, with lengths of 3 and 2. \n\nAs I enumerate rows, I notice Row 2 contains a 231 structure, where the first digit is a filler. And then in Row 5, the pattern returns to 131, continuing this structure through Row 10.\n\nFor a new input example, there's a similar shifting process occurring, where the pattern of 2 and 3 slides left across the columns. When it reaches certain constraints, filler rows appear to maintain the grid\u2019s shape!**Analyzing pattern sequences**\n\nI'm looking into how pattern sequences are generated and displayed across rows. The rules seem to depend on two pattern lengths and their repetitions. For each row, I choose a pattern based on its offset and current index. \n\nIf the chosen offset exceeds the available width, I cap it to avoid going out of bounds. For different examples, I'm noticing that when input rows are identical, the output simply replicates those rows until the desired count is reached. It seems shifting patterns only occurs under certain conditions, like having multiple unique patterns. Otherwise, they repeat the input row. This consistency in rules across examples helps clarify how to form the outputs.**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI need to ensure that there's no overlooked pattern. Initially, I considered if 808 or 087 could be relevant, but the input sequence is 0, 8, and 7 from 777087777. The segments at positions 4 and 5 reveal the pattern [0, 8] with a length of 2. Since I only found one distinct shape, the output will consist of ten identical rows. Therefore, I'll print 777087777 ten times, creating a grid with those repeating lines.",
