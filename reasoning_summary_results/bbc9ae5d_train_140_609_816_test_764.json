    "reasoning": "**Evaluating string shifts**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that there seems to be a discrepancy with how the shifting works in these examples. For the first example, it looks like we should have obtained 5559 by replacing the non-5 digit, but instead, it outputs 5552. This makes me question whether I misunderstood the concept of \"shifting.\" Perhaps it\u2019s more about rotating rather than a straightforward shift. It seems we might need to visualize the grid as a 1D structure and repeatedly shift until we reach a certain condition. There's definitely more to explore here!**Analyzing shifts in digits**\n\nIt seems like the next logical shift would lead to 5555, but they stopped before reaching an all-digits scenario. For example three, they shifted to 7772 and paused. I'm starting to think the number of steps might relate to the distinct digits in the original number. If we take the first example, we see two unique digits, but they only performed one shift. \n\nThis makes me wonder if the process continues only until the last character matches a specific digit from the original. For example one, I notice the last character of 5552 matches the second character of the original. I'll need to test this hypothesis further across the examples!**Finalizing shift calculations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how many lines they could have generated based on the shifts. For instance, in example two, if they had continued after line four, they could have reached all twos, but they stopped at the fifth line instead. \n\nThis leads me to believe that for a total of n=8, generating four lines, they would get the expected outputs up to a certain shift. Following through, I see the final confirmations lead to the sequence being correct with shifts producing expected results. So my output grid is: \n\n11111266  \n11111126  \n11111112  \n11111111",
