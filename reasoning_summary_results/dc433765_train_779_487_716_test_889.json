    "reasoning": "**Analyzing positions**\n\nI'm figuring out the relationship between the numbers in the grid. The 4 is in row 4, and the 5 is positioned two rows above in row 2, but they're not adjacent. I'm checking the indexing to clarify things: \n\nRow 0 has all 3s, while row 1 contains a 5 at position 7, meaning it's the last digit there. The original placement shows that the 5 indeed moved from row 1 to row 2, which makes sense as it moved one step down. It\u2019s an interesting positioning dynamic!**Examining token movement**\n\nFirst, I noticed the 9 moved up from row 4 to row 3, which makes sense since they\u2019re going toward the 4 that's above it in row 2. Then, for the 5, it starts above the 4 and moves down to row 4. In the third case, the 2 moves down toward the 4, confirming the pattern.\n\nThe general rule seems to be: in a column, the unmarked token moves toward the marker (usually the 4), switching its position with background tokens. They may even change columns to align horizontally, which adds a layer of complexity!**Clarifying token movement**\n\nThe 9 was moved one row up towards the 4, aligning in the same column, but initially, they weren't in the same column. In the first example, the 9 moved from (4,5) to (3,3), which means it jumped two columns and one row, not just a single step. This suggests they prioritized horizontal movement first before vertical.\n\nIn the second case, both tokens were already vertical, making it easier, but it seems they often adjust non-target tokens to a midpoint. The midpoint calculation indicates they might be rounding down when placing the token. It's an interesting pattern!",
