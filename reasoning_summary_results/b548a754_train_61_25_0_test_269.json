    "reasoning": "**Mapping rectangle coordinates**\n\nI'm trying to identify the pattern formed by the number 4 in the input data. I\u2019ve realized I need to list the coordinates of 4s \u2014 like mapping from row 1, column 4 to row 5, column 6, creating a rectangle. The shape of this pattern seems to be a hollow square or a plus sign with missing centers. The border consists mostly of 4s, except for some middle cells which are 7s. Specifically, row 3, column 5 is 7, along with row 2 and row 4, column 5.**Analyzing shape overlap**\n\nIn the input, I see that the 7s form a vertical line in column 5 across rows 2 to 4. It seems like I have two overlapping shapes: a hollow rectangle made of 4s and a column filled with 7s. The hollow rectangle has filled borders on rows 1 and 5, with 4s on columns 4 to 6. \n\nThe 7s fill the middle area of this rectangle, especially row 3, column 5. When I consider the output, it appears I've expanded the overall shape, moving the borders of the rectangle to encompass more cells. So now, the shapes have grown, creating a 5x5 rectangle with additional filled areas for the 7s.**Evaluating shape expansions**\n\nI'm analyzing how shapes expand in the input structure. It looks like the inner rectangle in the example starts as a single cell and expands vertically to include rows 2 and 3. As for the outer rectangle, it's drawn from rows 1 to 4 and columns 2 to 4, which means it\u2019s expanded upward, but not downward. \n\nThe expansion rules seem to maintain background color preservation for symmetry. The outer rectangle shifts to center within the structure while also preserving vertical height. However, I notice ambiguity in left and right expansions, as they don't always align perfectly with background constraints.",
