I notice patterns like row 1 having mostly 7's except at the 2nd column, where it's a 1. Rows 2 through 4 are full of 1's as well, while rows 5-7 show clusters of 8's in the first column. I want to identify the smallest cluster, and it seems the region with color 1 is quite expansive, while color 8 has a smaller cluster of three. Color 7 is prevalent throughout.**Exploring Color Regions and Grids**\n\nIt looks like the 8 region has a size of 3 and the 1 region likely measures around 13. In row 2, there are 7 ones, plus additional ones in specific columns across rows 1 to 7. This means I have two distinct regions: one for color 1 at 13 pixels and another for color 8 at 3 pixels. The smaller size suggests I should focus on the 8 region, but the output shows a 5x2 grid pattern, which is puzzling. I need to think about the minimal bounding box for the regions and what that implies for the overall shape.**Analyzing Row and Column Patterns**\n\nThe output shows two rows of 77, which come from the first and third rows of the input, and three rows of 87 from rows 5-7. This creates a total of five rows. I\u2019m trying to figure out the pattern behind this selection; it seems they may have excluded one duplicate of the 77 rows. There\u2019s a potential rule where the number of output rows equals the number of columns minus two. It appears columns with uniform colors are removed, but uniform rows might be retained. I need to clarify how many rows are kept versus removed based on these observations.",
