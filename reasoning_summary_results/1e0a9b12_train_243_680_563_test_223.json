It looks like the outputs are modified versions of the inputs, particularly in how the last digit changes. I notice that input rows containing the digit \u20185\u2019 have specific positions, and in the outputs, those \u20185\u2019s seem to be shifting or transforming. I\u2019ll highlight and mark these positions in the input to understand better how the pattern operates and see if there\u2019s a rotational aspect too.**Understanding shape translations**\n\nI\u2019m identifying the bottommost points of shapes in the data. The bottom of column nine is at row four, while the bottom of column five is at row five. When translating these shapes downwards, there\u2019s a shift involved\u2014specifically, a translation of +2 for column five and +3 for column nine. Each connected component is moving downward, just like gravity pulls things down until they rest at the bottom row. It seems like the rule is to move each uniform colored shape down as far as possible.**Implementing gravity mechanics**\n\nI'm analyzing the shapes in the grid. There's a shape of 4 in column 4 and a segmented shape of 7 in column 6, which isn't contiguous. It seems these colored blocks need to move down in a way that respects gravity\u2014essentially treating non-background shapes as blocks that fall until they hit the bottom row or another block. I\u2019ll simulate this for both examples, ensuring blocks maintain their initial vertical order while dropping down to fill the available spaces below. Let's proceed to examine each column carefully.",
