    "reasoning": "**Understanding the output transformation**\n\nI\u2019m examining how the input matrix changes, particularly when '6' replaces occurrences in column 5. It\u2019s interesting that only certain rows reflect this change. For instance, in the example provided, the input is a 6x8 matrix of digits. I realize the '0' from column 4 of row 1 moves to the end, transforming the output to \"11115550.\" Similarly, I see how the same logic applies to row 4, where '0' shifts to column 8. It's a neat pattern!**Clarifying the movement logic**\n\nI'm analyzing how certain digits transform in a grid. In row 6, the input \"11110555\" changes to \"11111550,\" where the '0' from column 5 moves to the end. Interesting! It seems only rows with zeros are modified. For rows without zeros, such as row 2 and row 3, they remain unchanged. It appears the rule is to identify the unique digit in each row\u2014specifically the one that appears only once\u2014and move it to the end while shifting others left. That's quite a neat pattern!**Interpreting the movement rule**\n\nI'm exploring the rule for moving colors based on their frequency in a grid. The process seems to focus on identifying colors that appear exactly once in a row, but there can be confusion when multiple colors meet this criterion. For instance, in row 8, colors 7 and 3 both appear once, which complicates things. However, it seems the rule prioritizes the globally rare color. I observe in the examples how the colors are moved, specifically focusing on the least frequent color in the entire grid. This understanding builds a clearer algorithm!**Implementing the row transformation**\n\nI'm understanding that I can only apply the transformation once per row based on a specific color, C, which is the globally least frequent color. For each applicable row, if C isn't in the last column, I'll shift the left neighboring pixel to the current position of C and replace the last position with C. \n\nLooking through the test input, I find matches for C in certain rows while skipping others. This leads me to a consistent output across the grid, which results in a neatly transformed structure. I've confirmed these steps work reliably!",
