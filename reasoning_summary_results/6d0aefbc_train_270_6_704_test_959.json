In the first example, each three-digit row simply duplicates itself. The second example shows a trend where the reverse of each row is appended. For instance, \u201c522\u201d becomes \u201c522225\u201d because \u201c225\u201d is the reverse\u2014this pattern continues for other rows. It's interesting to see how reversing plays a role!**Verifying transformation rules**\n\nI'm breaking down the transformations based on the examples. For instance, \"707\" becomes \"707707\" since its reverse is the same. Next, \"4337\" becomes \"43377334\" as its reverse is \"7334,\" which fits the pattern. For \"2108,\" I see its reverse \"8012\" leads to \"21088012\" through appending, which works. The rule is clear: I append the reverse of each row to itself. Applying this rule to new inputs gives me a straightforward output grid. Let's finalize just that grid!",
