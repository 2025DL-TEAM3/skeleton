For example, starting with `19777`, the first half is `19777`, and the second half becomes the reverse, so `77791`. The same goes for `77077`, which is a palindrome. The output there is `7707777077` because both halves are identical. For `27737`, the output is `2773773772`, confirming the same pattern of input and reverse, creating a clear structure. It all seems consistent!**Defining Output Structure**\n\nIt looks like I'm working through a rule to create outputs by concatenating each input with its reverse. For example, for the input `5555`, the reversed portion is the same, leading to the output `5555 5555`. I confirm the pattern holds for several other inputs and their reverses. Now, using the new inputs, I calculate each row\u2019s output. The final outputs are `88422488`, `68800886`, and `25888852`. It seems everything checks out, and the formatting is consistent!",
