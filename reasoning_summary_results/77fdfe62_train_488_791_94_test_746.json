The interior, framed by 2s, yields a central area of 6x4 once I remove the outer and interior uniform borders. It seems consistent across examples that both outer and inner frames share the same color. This leads to a pattern where, after removing two homogeneous layers, the result is a central image of size (H-4)x(W-4). I'm curious about whether the central content changes in the outputs.**Examining central content transformation**\n\nI'm looking at the central content of a 6x4 matrix derived from example1. Initially, I extract the specific rows and columns but notice discrepancies between the extracted central row and the output row. It seems like there\u2019s a transformation happening\u2014maybe a counting or mapping of digits. As I identify the central subgrid, I also try to pinpoint a consistent mapping from the extracted values to the output. The mapping isn't straightforward, as numbers seem to change in value based on their positions.**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m diving into the outputs, specifically checking how the first two columns reflect counts of certain values. As I analyze, I find some discrepancies between the extracted central content and the actual output, suggesting there might be transformations at play. It seems likely that the output encodes data such as run lengths of colors, where each color's length gets recorded instead of raw values. This coding pattern might clarify how counts or runs of specific colors translate into the final outputs. I'm curious to uncover the underlying rules governing these transformations.**Making a plausible guess**\n\nI'm considering a minimal guess for an unsolvable problem, and I'm arriving at an output of: \n\n77  \n17  \n17  \n71  \n\nI'm aware that this could be incorrect, but I'm sticking to the given instructions that state to provide the output grid in the format shown in examples. Since my test input grid is 8x6, this translates to a 4x2 output. It feels a bit uncertain, but I'm going with it for now!",
