For the first example, the 6x6 input grid produces a 4x2 output grid by selecting the top-left quadrant. The first two rows of 7s in the input translate to \"77\" in the output, while the next two rows of 8s translate to \"88.\" So, the output correctly corresponds to the input's specified sections.**Analyzing the second example**\n\nFor this example, I have an 8x5 input grid and need to determine how it produces a 5x2 output grid. The output rows seem to derive from the last two columns (4 and 5) of the input, but I discover that those columns are used in reverse for the output. So for rows 1 and 2, both give \"66\", while rows 4 and 5 give \"77.\" This suggests they've focused on rows where there's a change in values. It aligns well with the previous example\u2019s logic!**Constructing and checking the grid**\n\nI\u2019m numbering the rows 1-6 and columns 1-4 and filling in the grid. Rows with identical entries (all 9s) will be dropped, leaving rows 4, 5, and 6. Now I need to check for constant columns across the entire original matrix, not just the remaining rows. Columns 1 and 2 are all 9s, so they're dropped, while columns 3 and 4 contain a mix, so they\u2019re kept. This gives me a subgrid, and after reversing the column order, the final output is:\n\n22  \n02  \n02  \n\nEverything seems consistent!",
