Looking at the first example with a 7x4 input grid filled with digits, the output is a compact 4x2 grid. \n\nIn each case, the input grids appear to be defined by a digit border shape. For instance, in Example 1, I noticed a border of 4s surrounding a 2x2 block of 7s and a couple of 3s underneath. It seems the digit organization within the grid is key to answering these puzzles.**Examining Input and Output Grids**\n\nI\u2019m identifying the layers in my grid: there\u2019s a top layer of 7s and a layer of 3s, but it looks like the top-right cell of the second layer is a 7, not a 3. The output grid corresponds with columns 3-4 from rows 3-6 of the input. However, I notice a discrepancy: the output prints 73 instead of 37 from the subgrid. This might indicate they flipped or rotated the grid. \n\nFor example, in the second input, there's also an interior shape defined by the rows and columns.**Understanding the Subgrid and Output**\n\nI\u2019m examining the relationship between the subgrid and its output. For example, in my current case, I notice that the second row of the subgrid shows elements swapped, leading to a mirrored output. This suggests that there's a horizontal flipping occurring with the rows.\n\nIn another example, I can identify the interior region to extract non-border values and mirror them. The general rule seems to be identifying the border color, extracting the non-border area, and flipping it horizontally for the output grid. I\u2019ll ensure to preserve the shape in my final outputs while maintaining accuracy.",
