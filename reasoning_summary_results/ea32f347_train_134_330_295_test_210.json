    "reasoning": "**Analyzing puzzle patterns**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle where I'm replacing certain numbers in a 10x10 grid. The grid is mostly filled with 5's, but I've noticed some transformations happening to certain regions. For instance, the first row maintains all 5's, while in the second row, a 6 changes to a 1. Similar transformations exist for 9\u2019s in other rows, and it seems the mappings depend on their positions. I need to sort out the rules behind these changes!**Exploring mapping rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how numbers transform in the given grid. In Row 9, for instance, three 9's become 4's, while a solitary 9 changes to a 2. It seems that the mapping is influenced by the component sizes. Vertical lines of greater than size one turn into 1\u2019s, while horizontal components of size three become 4\u2019s. Single elements like the isolated 9 get replaced by 2's. I\u2019m puzzled about why these specific mappings occur, as there seems to be some arbitrary reasoning behind them.**Defining mapping rules**\n\nI'm examining how distinct shapes get assigned colors in this puzzle. Each shape is mapped to a unique color based on its type\u2014vertical bars to 1, single cells to 2, and horizontal bars to 4. I notice that the mapping can change based on context and original colors. The goal seems to be detecting and classifying connected shapes, assigning colors as needed. The numbers 1, 2, and 4 appear to be consistent choices, possibly due to them being the smallest available, avoiding the background color.**Processing non-7 components**\n\nI'm looking at how to handle non-7 connected components while keeping the 7\u2019s background intact. The task involves identifying connected groups of pixels that are not 7's, which include 5's, 9's, and 3's. For example, in Row 3, I notice a vertical line of three 5's that will map to 4. I also find groups of 9's and a single 3 that need to be converted to new values based on their sizes. After making these changes, I end up with a formatted output grid that reflects the adjustments accurately.",
