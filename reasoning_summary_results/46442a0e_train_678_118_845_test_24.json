    "reasoning": "**Analyzing puzzle patterns**\n\nI\u2019ve got three training examples that resemble puzzles from ARC. The input grid features strings arranged in rows. For example, the first input is a 5x5 grid, leading to a 10x10 output. When I check the second example, the pattern remains the same\u2014input 4 rows of 4 yield 8 rows of 8. It's starting to seem like the output dimensions double each time. The process might involve rotating quadrants or summation. Considering the smallest case can help clarify things.**Exploring grid transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how the input grid transforms into a 4x4 output. The first step shows how two rows produce the larger grid, with symmetries and patterns. It seems the output grid involves placing a 2x2 block in each quadrant, possibly through rotations or mirror effects.\n\nI can look at how each input row shifts to form different parts of the output grid. It appears symmetrical, which suggests effective transformations across quadrants. The arrangement seems consistent, indicating a structured tiling of rotations.**Constructing grid rotations**\n\nI'm working on arranging a grid based on rotations. For the original 2x2 grid, I discovered that its rotations form a larger structure when tiled together. It seems the output should be organized into quadrants; the original grid occupies the top-left, while the other quadrants represent its 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, and 270\u00b0 rotations.\n\nUsing a specific example, I verify how these rotations work by identifying positions and confirming patterns. For a 3x3 input, I calculate the rotations carefully, ensuring each block fits together to create a cohesive 6x6 output grid.**Finalizing grid output**\n\nI\u2019m putting together the output grid, combining rows from both original and rotated sections. The first three rows form by merging the original matrix and its 90\u00b0 rotation, while the last three rows integrate other rotations. The output structure checks out to be:\n\n965349  \n420726  \n371105  \n501173  \n627024  \n943569  \n\nI\u2019m confirming everything aligns with examples and symmetry checks to ensure consistency. Each transformed section follows the expected patterns, with correct elements positioned. Looks good!",
