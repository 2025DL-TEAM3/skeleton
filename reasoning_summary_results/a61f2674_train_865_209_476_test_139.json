I see three training examples mapping 5x10, 5x9, and 5x9 grids to outputs of similar size, but with some digits altered or colors changed. Now, I need to apply the inferred rule to a new 6x4 grid. It's a bit tricky\u2014but I'm up for the challenge! Let's figure out how the patterns might shift with this different grid size.**Reformatting examples**\n\nI'm looking to reformat some examples for clarity. For the first example, I have a grid of 5 rows and 10 columns, where some interior rows with 4's transform into 1's or 2's based on their position. It seems the 4's at row 2 become 1's, and those at row 4 become 2's, likely indicating their vertical position or \"block\" number.\n\nThe second example presents a 5x9 grid where I need to break down the rows into clearer patterns. It looks like there's some inconsistency to untangle, but I'm on it!**Finding connected components**\n\nI'm analyzing region sizes to label them in the output grid. It looks like I'm replacing regions of size 3 with 1's and size 1 with 2's, keeping the background intact. The largest region becomes 1, and the next largest becomes 2, following the rank order. Now I need to apply this to a new grid with zeros as the background and 7's as the special color. \n\nI identified two connected components of 7's: one of size 4 and one of size 1. So, I\u2019ll replace the larger component with 1's and the smaller with a 2. The result will look like the specified output grid, ensuring everything matches correctly!",
