In the example provided, the input consists of rows of 4-digit strings, and the output has rows of 3 digits\u2014essentially removing the trailing zero from each row. It\u2019s also notable that repeated rows appear only once, so the first occurrence of any row is kept. The zeros act as indicators of the background, essentially ignored in the final output.**Clarifying the extraction process**\n\nThe task involves extracting connected non-zero digits from a grid of numbers. The input represents a grid, and zeros are to be removed around the blocks of non-zero digits, resulting in sequences. For example, one input contains repeated rows and only the unique sequences are listed. \n\nIn one case, each row has zeros as padding, and the output displays the unique digits from the clusters, compressing consecutive duplicates. So, for example, the sequence \u201c196668\u201d is compressed to \u201c1968.\u201d Essentially, it condenses the data while removing unnecessary parts!**Understanding component compression rules**\n\nIn analyzing the rows of digits, I'm recognizing that groups of the same digit are treated as components, and their sizes determine how they appear in the output. For example, if there are three contiguous 6's, they compress to one 6. The reasoning leads me to keep components of size 2 or less, while compressing those larger than 2 into a single entry. \n\nThis means, for an area covering multiple rows and columns, I\u2019ll keep track of unique patterns and drop duplicates, resulting in a clear output that reflects these rules. The logic seems sound across different examples!**Summarizing the puzzle solution**\n\nIn this puzzle, I'm noting that the component of 9's spans multiple positions. The component size for 9's totals 13 due to connections between rows. When the component size exceeds 2, I compress it to a single entry. \n\nOn the other hand, a component size of 2 means I keep the full occurrences. Thus, for row0, I get \"19,\" and for row2, simply \"9.\" I skip duplicate rows to finalize the grid: \n\n19  \n9  \n\nThis is the output format requested.",
