I\u2019m questioning whether column 4 or 3 is symmetric on the left. They only placed an 8 in column 4. In checking example one, the grid has a pattern with rows of 2 and 7s. The top four rows form a diagonal 'Z' shape with the 7s in specific columns. It looks like there are indeed two columns of 7s.**Mapping positions of 7s**\n\nI\u2019m mapping the positions of the 7s in the grid: I found them at (0,2), (1,1), (2,1), and (3,2), forming a U shape with two spikes at (1,1) and (2,1) vertically, while (0,2) and (3,2) spread out horizontally. The input grid is 8 rows by 10 columns, with the cluster of 7s being 4 pixels wide. They\u2019ve added 8s in positions (0,3) and (1,3), which correspond to the cluster's endpoints and hint at an axis of symmetry around column 5.5.**Exploring grid placements**\n\nThe grid has a width of 9, with the center at column 4. I notice they place vertical lines symmetrically around this center. In another example with a width of 10, the symmetry leads to mirroring clusters of numbers. For instance, the 7 cluster from columns 1 and 2 shifts to the right at column 3, which suggests a pattern. \n\nThese patterns appear to highlight important features, like marking the largest regions. I wonder if they might be moving shapes up or down, as seen with the 4s becoming 8s in the output. This movement seems to create a gravity-like effect in the pattern.",
