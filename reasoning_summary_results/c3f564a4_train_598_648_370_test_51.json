    "reasoning": "**Understanding row patterns**\n\nI'm thinking about how rows alternate starting from the bottom but are assigned differently. It seems the top row, assigned as row 7, serves as the starting point for the pattern, alternating A and B from there. In example three, row inputs show only A's due to clean data. The process involves identifying uncorrupted rows that alternate two digits across columns and choosing distinct patterns from them. If only one pattern exists, I'll pick that. If two exist, like in example two, I can select between them.**Identifying perfect rows**\n\nI'm sorting through which rows can be considered perfect in example one. Rows one and eight seem perfect checker patterns, but I wonder if any intermediates are as well. I decide to assign A based on which row might appear in the final configuration's top position. Given that the first row is perfect (3737373737), I select it as A. However, if the row isn't perfect, I\u2019d pick based on the corresponding bottom row instead.\n\nIn example two, given that the first row (24242999) isn't perfect, I select A as the other perfect pattern that starts with the digit in the first column. For instance, if row one indicates 2, I choose the perfect row that starts with 2. Meanwhile, example three shows a repeating pattern rather than an alternating one, so only A applies here.**Analyzing row patterns**\n\nI'm working through how to identify perfect rows based on their patterns. The goal is to find candidate rows that appear multiple times but match a consistent tiling without anomalies. In example two, rows like 24242424 and 42424242 have perfect alternations, while others don\u2019t fit the criteria. \n\nExample three shows that 7107107107 is perfect, while another row isn't. I want to ensure I consider rows with smaller periodic patterns. If I find only one perfect pattern, I'll fill the grid accordingly, alternating rows of A and B or just A if necessary. In this test case, the only perfect pattern I find is 24242424, so that's what the rows will be filled with.",
