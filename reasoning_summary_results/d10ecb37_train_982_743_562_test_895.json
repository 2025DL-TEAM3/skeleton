For instance, analyzing sample one, which consists of eight rows of three-digit numbers, I can list all possible two-digit substrings. For example, from the row \"454,\" I get substrings 45 and 54. I'll tally the occurrences of each substring and identify the two most frequent ones to provide the expected outputs back to the user.**Counting frequencies in digits**\n\nI'm analyzing the frequency of two-digit numbers derived from the grid. For instance, \"45\" occurs in \"454\" and \"452,\" giving it a count of 2. Meanwhile, \"44\" appears multiple times, totaling 5 occurrences from various rows. The output seems to prioritize the second most frequent (45) first, followed by the most frequent (44). I wonder if there\u2019s another underlying rule influencing this, perhaps related to how rows start or the overall digit occurrence counts in the grid.**Identifying the 2x2 grid rule**\n\nFor each sample, the outputs appear to consistently form a 2x2 grid derived from the top-left corner of the input grids. For example, in sample one, the output \"45\" and \"44\" corresponds to the 2x2 subgrid found in the initial rows. I see similar patterns in other samples, like \"33\" and \"34\" in the second sample and \"00\" and \"70\" in the third. This suggests a straightforward rule where the output always comes from the top-left 2x2 area of the input grid, a method that seems almost too simple but likely follows the established task framework.",
