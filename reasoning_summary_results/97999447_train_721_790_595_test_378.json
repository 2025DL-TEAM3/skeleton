In the 6x5 grid provided, the first two cells to the right of the marker will be filled with 5 and then the marker color, repeating this pattern throughout.**Finalizing the grid output**\n\nI need to identify the values in Row 2 from columns 2 to 5, which will all be replaced with 5 and the marker, giving me Row 2 as 8, 5, 8, 5, 8. For the entire output, Row 1 remains unchanged as there are no unique pixels there.
