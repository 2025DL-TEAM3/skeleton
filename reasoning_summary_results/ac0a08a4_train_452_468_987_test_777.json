    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC task expansion**\n\nI'm looking at the ARC tasks where inputs are expanded into outputs. In the example, the input grid is expanded by a factor of two, creating a larger pattern. The input has 4 rows and 3 columns, while the output features 8 rows and 6 columns. Each input cell turns into a 2x2 block, which effectively scales the structure. The shift in dimensions makes sense, as each value in the input replicates to create the new format. It\u2019s all about understanding the replication!**Understanding input-output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how input grids scale to outputs in block patterns, noticing changes in the blocks. For example, in a grid where input[2][1] equals 9, the corresponding output has \u201899\u2019 replicated properly. It looks like each cell really becomes a 2x2 block in the output grid. In one case, the input had 4 rows and 3 columns, expanding to 8 rows and 6 columns confirms my scaling rule. I\u2019ll apply this to a new input grid to verify the results.**Mapping input to output rows**\n\nI'm laying out how the input grid translates to the output grid. Each input row corresponds to two output rows. For instance, row 0 maps to output rows 0 and 1, both displaying '555555'. Row 2 transforms into '559955', while row 3 results in '555500'. I\u2019ve verified all mappings and ensured they are consistent with the examples. The final output will clearly reflect this pattern, showing how each input translates into the desired output grid effectively.",
