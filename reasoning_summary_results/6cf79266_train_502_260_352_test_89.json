    "reasoning": "**Analyzing zero connectivity**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that all zeros connected orthogonally form distinct regions. There\u2019s a large zero region in the top-left and a smaller one in the center. Interestingly, the zeros around (5,4) connect back to (4,4), but there's a barrier at (4,4) that splits them. While zeros from (1,1) to (4,3) belong to the top-left area, I need to clarify how they connect and whether the zeros in the lower region might affect this.**Testing zero filling rules**\n\nI\u2019m examining how to fill zeros based on the examples provided. In the first example, it looks like we might initially stop filling at the first non-zero, but then I notice row three still outputs a 1 despite that. So maybe we\u2019re counting a specific pattern instead. \n\nIn the second example, I see leading zeros are replaced by 1s until hitting non-zero digits. The goal seems to fill all contiguous zeros that reach the top-left corner of the grid. So, I\u2019m identifying blocks of zeros to determine fill rules better.**Examining filling rules further**\n\nI'm diving into example two and evaluating how zeros are filled based on non-zero positions. For rows one to three, zeros in columns one to six were filled, but in row four, there\u2019s an interesting pattern: non-zeros like (4) at column one and (2) at column three, while (0) at column two isn\u2019t filled. \n\nThis suggests they fill zeros only if they\u2019re sequentially surrounded by non-zero digits in certain conditions. It seems the filling rule focuses on connecting runs of zeros up to a threshold determined by surrounding non-zero digits. It\u2019s tricky, but identifying these patterns is key!",
