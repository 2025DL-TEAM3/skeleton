    "reasoning": "**Visualizing shapes in ex2**\n\nI'm trying to map out the shapes of 2's and 8's in this example. For Row 0, I see a 2 at (0,2), while Row 1 has all 2's. Row 2 places 2's at several spots, and Row 3 shows a series of 2's mixed with some 0's. Rows 0-5 create a clear pattern of 2's. Moving to Rows 6-9, they feature multiple 8's. It looks like the bottom right forms a rectangle filled with 8's, which is quite interesting!**Analyzing shapes and counts**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that the 8's form a circular shape, while the top region might look like a canoe with 2's, and the bottom region mirrors that with 8's. I might need to count these shapes for an output of 2x2, like [2, 0; 0, 2]. The top half would then have two shapes of type A (2\u2019s) and none of type B (8\u2019s). I'll have to check for the counts in the next example too, focusing on color and shape types.**Counting shapes and holes**\n\nI'm analyzing shapes and their counts in this grid. Starting from Row 0, I notice positions of 5\u2019s and 7\u2019s, tallying them up. It seems the output isn't just direct counts but might involve counting shapes of 5's and patterns of 7's. Reflecting on the task reveals it\u2019s about recognizing connected components of color 2 in the top half; all 2's here form a single connected shape. The next step is to identify any holes in this shape, which could relate to the output matrix. The bottom region with color 8 might also reveal a solid rectangle pattern.**Identifying shape clusters**\n\nI\u2019m working on finding connected clusters of colors within the grid. It seems like color 8 has multiple clusters, and I need to check connections between them. For color 9, there are various positions too. I'm also considering if zeros represent a background. The goal is to identify closed loops that form rectangles, particularly in the patterns found in rows 7 to 9. Noticing output dimensions suggests I might have to apply a tile mapping function based on prior examples. Each tile size appears consistent; I\u2019ll examine patterns for transformations to uncover a more definitive solution.**Finding contiguous shapes**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on identifying contiguous zeros that might form a border in the middle region. After sorting the zeros by their row positions, it appears most zeros cluster around the bottom-left. I need to check various regions to confirm if they could form a rectangular frame. I realize I misread some values earlier and need to re-evaluate them. Once I find the correct frame of color 1, I will extract the interior, which has specific values, leading to the final output grid of \u201c3\u201d and \u201c2.\u201d",
