    "reasoning": "**Analyzing positions of '9's**\n\nI'm working with a 10-row input of length 7, looking at the distribution of '9's across the rows. The identified positions are (0,1), (3,3), (4,2), and (7,2). I've confirmed these positions by checking each row's pattern.  \nNow, for the output, rows 5 and 6 will fill in based on the vertical connection created by rows 4 to 7. However, I need to consider if the other connections between positions (0,1) and (3,3) are valid.**Connecting occurrences of '9's and '4's**\n\nI need to focus on connecting the '9's that appear exactly twice in the same column. For the current pattern, only the '9's in column 2 at rows 4 and 7 are connected. There aren't any partners for the '9's in column 3 or row 0. Next, I'm looking at '4's in another example where columns with exactly two occurrences require a vertical connection. \n\nThe rows show how '4's at specific positions connect vertically as well. As a result, I'll highlight how row 6 changes in my final output, retaining some original elements while connecting new ones.**Connecting numbers in columns and rows**\n\nI'm analyzing the connections between columns and rows with the numbers '4' and '9'. It seems we have some confusion about why certain columns were filled horizontally. In the third example, '4's at column 3 connect vertically, but row 6 sees some horizontal filling as well, despite only having individual '4's elsewhere. \n\nIt looks like I need to apply a rule: if a row has at least two of the same number, I should fill the spaces between them horizontally, while also connecting vertically for columns with two occurrences. This finds the right connections in both dimensions.",
