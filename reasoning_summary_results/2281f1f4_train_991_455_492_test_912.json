    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the grid structure**\n\nI'm considering the arrangement of 5's in the grid. It looks like they form vertical bars in certain columns, specifically column one spanning rows 1 to 4 and 7. In row 8, there's a cluster of 5's extending from columns 3 to 6 and column 8, creating boundaries that define some enclosed areas for filling with 2\u2019s. I'm mapping out the grid, looking at how the walls formed by the 5's create unique spatial shapes. There's definitely something interesting about how these chambers form!**Mapping enclosed spaces**\n\nI'm thinking it might be a better approach to identify connected components of 1\u2019s in the grid. I\u2019d fill these with 2's unless they touch the border or are adjacent to 5's. The 5's act as walls, enclosing cavities that hold 1's. I need to check if there are any regions of 1's entirely surrounded by 5\u2019s, as they should be filled with 2's. I\u2019ll also plot out the wall positions to understand their shape better and see which areas of 1's remain unconnected to the edge.**Exploring interior regions**\n\nI\u2019m considering the regions of 1's that are surrounded by walls formed by 5's. It seems there's a pocket of 1's that\u2019s enclosed\u2014except there's no wall on the right, so it\u2019s not fully closed. The walls in this grid shape might show patterns similar to a fractal catastrophe, indicating different fill rules. I also noticed that in previous examples, filling regions often relied on adjacency to the color boundary. I need to map out walls clearly to see how the enclosed areas operate in each scenario.**Determining wall colors**\n\nIn the first example, I notice that color 5 shows up much more frequently than 8, suggesting 5 is the background and 8 is the wall. The edges contain 8, but I need to ensure it's present on at least two edges. Looking at the grid, I see 8 at three edges, but I'll focus on rows with more than one occurrence, specifically the left and bottom edges, since those are the ones where I can fill in 2 for the grid positions I've pinpointed. I need to finalize that output.",
