    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit replacements**\n\nI'm looking over the rows and noting changes: where the first digit switches from 5 to 8 while others remain unchanged. For example, in rows like 2 and 4, only the 5 changes. It seems like the digit 5 always turns into 8 in the output, while 0 and 3 do not change. The second digit might include some 7s, which stay the same. Overall, the notable pattern is that 5 is consistently replaced by 8.**Identifying digit swaps**\n\nI'm examining the rules regarding digit replacements, particularly focusing on the numbers 5 and 8. I see that in some training pairs, the digit 5 consistently swaps with 8 in specific positions. For example, the input-output mappings indicate that 8 changes to 5 and vice versa. The other digits remain unchanged. By checking through multiple rows, I can confirm that the overall rule is: digit 5 becomes 8, and digit 8 becomes 5, with the rest of the digits staying the same.**Verifying digit swaps**\n\nI'm checking the first training data to confirm the swapping rule for digits 5 and 8. Since there are no 8s in the initial cases, I only need to replace 5s with 8s. For the test input \"49050221,\" I change the 5 to an 8, resulting in \"49080221.\" In the second test input \"42848994,\" I replace the 8s with 5s, leading to \"42545994.\" So the correct outputs are: \n\n49080221  \n42545994",
