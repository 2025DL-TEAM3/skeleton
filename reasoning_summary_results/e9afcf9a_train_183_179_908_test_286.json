    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI'm trying to figure out a grid where the majority color is 4, with some instances of 5. The input has 4 filling every cell except for row 4, which is entirely filled with 5. In the output, it looks like there's a checkerboard pattern with rows 2 and 4 displaying alternating colors. So, it seems they're only applying this pattern to the even-indexed rows, filling in a checkerboard style. Let me investigate further to clarify!**Exploring checkerboard patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing how a checkerboard pattern is applied in the grid. For instance, in the first example, the top-left starts with color 4, but the output shows row 1 remains constant with 4. It seems they only apply the pattern to even rows, which initially had a different majority color. In the second example with nine rows, a similar pattern emerges. It looks like they\u2019re alternating colors based on neighboring rows\u2019 colors. I need to investigate this alternating pattern further!**Investigating stripe patterns**\n\nI\u2019m piecing together how the output colors are determined based on input stripes. For instance, in stripe 1, where the color is 8, it seems to alternate with color 7 in the output. I\u2019m considering whether the output chooses colors based on adjacent stripes. Notably, the pattern appears to apply to alternating rows, creating a checkerboard effect, particularly at boundaries between different colors. I find it interesting that only some rows display patterns while others remain uniform, so I'll need to delve deeper into the rules governing this transformation!**Understanding output patterns**\n\nI'm examining potential patterns in the grid based on the input colors. From my analysis, it looks like I should create a checkerboard pattern for rows with odd counts of color stripes. If a color appears an even number of times, then those rows stay uniform. For instance, colors 5 and 6 would alternate, while 7 and 0 remain the same. In my final suggestion, I could alternate starting with 6 for row 6 if needed, but I'll stick with the checkerboard pattern idea for clarity.",
