The first four numbers are kept, but I\u2019m curious why. Checking their digit sums doesn't show a pattern since one is even and another is odd. They aren't monotonic, so maybe it\u2019s about comparing halves? \n\nYet, that doesn\u2019t quite fit for all outputs. Interestingly, each of the kept numbers appears only once in the input, implying uniqueness might be key. Let's explore more!**Exploring number grid extraction**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a puzzle about extracting middle sections from a grid of n-digit numbers. For 4-digit numbers, the middle third seems tricky since it doesn\u2019t divide evenly. For 6-digit and 9-digit numbers, they pick blocks of three from the center.\n\nInteresting! For example 2, with 3 rows of 9, they pulled the middle three columns, giving outputs like '280'. Then for 3 rows of 6, the same strategy applies, and I notice that the selection can shift as well. Really, it seems primary focus is on symmetry and shape!**Examining grid extraction rules**\n\nIn example 2, they extract the middle block, and for example 3 with 6 columns, they take the second block of columns. But for example 1, they used a different approach with 4-digit numbers. It seems they focus on the central regions of the grid, keeping particular rows or columns.\n\nFor example 1, they output full columns but subset rows, while in examples 2 and 3 they do the opposite. I\u2019m considering symmetry and how they determine which parts to keep based on patterns in color regions. It looks like they prioritize central sections in their selections.",
