    "reasoning": "**Mapping columns and values**\n\nI\u2019m working on mapping values to columns based on examples. For instance, I see that col5 outputs 4 for row1, col9 outputs 3 for row2, and col2 outputs 2 for row4. I\u2019m identifying two clusters: columns 2 and 3 map to 2, 5 and 6 map to 4, and columns 7, 8, and 9 map to 3. However, I'm not sure how to categorize col1 or col4 since there are no examples for those. It seems a bit unclear.**Identifying anomalies in rows**\n\nI\u2019m working on finding anomalies in each row and determining their section index. I\u2019ll map the sections according to the column index and check the mapping: section 0 corresponds to 2, section 1 to 4, and section 2 to 3. For each row, I\u2019ll identify the unique number. For instance, in row 1, the unique number is '5' found at column 3, leading to a color of 3. This process repeats for rows 2 and 3, resulting in the output grid of 333, 444, 444.",
