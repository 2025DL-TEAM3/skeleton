    "reasoning": "**Deciphering ARC Puzzle**\n\nI'm analyzing an ARC puzzle that involves inputting a grid of color numbers and determining how to output unique color counts. The input comprises rows of repeated colors, and the output seems to reflect the number of contiguous color rows listed sequentially.\n\nWith one example of the grid, I see that there are distinct blocks represented: three rows of \"2\", two rows of \"1\", two rows of \"0\", one row of \"9\", and then one more row of \"0\". Each block of color corresponds to an output row with its respective count. This clarifies the pattern!**Identifying Compression Rules**\n\nFrom the first input, we see that the output consists of five lines, each representing unique vertical runs of colors. For example, three rows of '2' yield '2', two rows of '1' yield '1', and so on.\n\nNext, I notice a second training example with identical rows of varied colors, which compresses horizontally. The output here is '9327' since it captures unique color blocks.\n\nIn the third input, vertical compression yields outputs based on the number of identical rows in contiguous blocks. I gather that the general rule is to compress along the axis where the rows change: horizontally when rows are the same, or vertically when they differ.**Understanding Compression Logic**\n\nIn the second example, I see that the output '9327' results from horizontal compression, where I detect repeated rows. If all rows are identical, I compress horizontally; if not, I use vertical compression.\n\nNow with the provided input, there are nine rows, and they aren't all identical. So I perform vertical compression by identifying contiguous color blocks. For rows one to three, I get '7', '9', and '4' respectively, while rows four to six yield one '0', and rows seven to eight output '2', with row nine giving '5'.\n\nUltimately, the output rows are:\n\n7  \n9  \n4  \n0  \n2  \n5  \n\nThis effectively captures the content just like the examples.",
