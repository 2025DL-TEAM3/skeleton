    "reasoning": "**Figuring out color mappings**\n\nI'm thinking about how to assign colors based on pixel sizes. It seems like I might consider the largest component as color 1 and the smallest as color 2. I'm trying to order them: Component A is the largest with 7 pixels, so it gets assigned color 1. Component B is the second largest with 2 pixels, so it should be color 4, and Component C is the smallest with 1 pixel, getting color 2. Although, I'm feeling a bit confused about the mappings and their order!**Analyzing components in grid**\n\nI\u2019m checking an example with 6 rows and 10 columns filled with numbers. It looks like there's a central block of 8's in row 2, spanning columns 4-8, which gives me a horizontal line of five 8's. Then I find three's in rows 4, 5, and 6. The third row has three 0's horizontally in column 8-10. So I identify distinct components with different sizes: a color 8 block with a size of 5, color 3 and color 0 both with size 3. Now I need to map these to new colors!**Resolving color mapping rules**\n\nI'm trying to figure out whether to separate components by orientation or color. It looks like the vertical lines and horizontal lines have different mappings. For example, in one case, three's came out as four while zero's became two, which is puzzling! In different examples, I've noticed some inconsistencies in how colors are assigned based on component size and orientation. I suspect that larger components get one color while smaller components get another. I\u2019m also considering how to break ties when components have the same size\u2014maybe by their orientation or original color. Let's see how this all fits together!**Mapping color outputs based on size**\n\nI'm focusing on how to assign new colors based on the size of components. It looks like the smallest original color gets the smallest new color, so input color 0 would map to 2 and color 3 to 4. I'm also considering how to resolve ties; it might be best to use the original color value. If sizes tie, the smaller original label might dictate the ranking. \n\nNow, I'm checking an input grid to determine the background color and identify non-background shapes, figuring out their sizes and how to map new colors to each component. After analyzing the components, I\u2019m confirming that the final mappings look correct and ensuring consistency in the output grid.",
