    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid output**\n\nI\u2019m working through how the input 3x3 grid translates to a 9x9 output grid. Each cell from the input grid expands into a 3x3 block, creating a symmetric arrangement. Looking closely at the first example shows the output rows: the first line is all ones, while rows two through five are identical. I notice that the last four lines consist of the same three ones followed by three threes. It\u2019s essential to confirm that these patterns are consistent across rows.**Mapping grid blocks**\n\nI\u2019m organizing the 9x9 output into 3x3 blocks based on the input grid. Each 3x3 block corresponds to sections of the 3x3 input grid. For instance, in Block row 1, I notice the arrangement of ones and threes, where the input at position (1,1) is observed as having a dominant value of 1 in the top row. However, the bottom rows reveal threes mixed in. \n\nIt seems we may have to reassess how these blocks relate to each other and explore more flexible arrangements rather than a strict uniform division.**Determining output rules**\n\nI'm analyzing the placement of moderate values in the output grid based on the input matrix. I see that the outputs are placed diagonally. For instance, the first example shows moderate values positioned on both the main diagonal and the off-diagonal. \n\nAs for the test inputs, it seems that the output for moderate values is determined by which diagonal has a majority, with the output shifting accordingly. For the final output grid, I\u2019ve strategically filled regions based on the established rules, yielding a clear and consistent result.",
