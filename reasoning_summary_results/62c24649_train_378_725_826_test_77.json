    "reasoning": "**Deciphering grid transformations**\n\nI have three training examples to analyze. The first input consists of a 4x5 grid represented by digits. The output is an 8x10 grid. It looks like there's a pattern where the dimensions double: 4 rows become 8, and 5 columns become 10. The second example follows the same logic: a 5x4 input transforms into a 10x8 output. The third one also confirms the pattern, where a 4x4 input results in an 8x8 output. Each input cell generates a 2x2 block, but the output numbers aren't just replicated; I need to investigate further.**Analyzing grid outputs**\n\nIn the first example, the input grid has four rows, and the output consists of eight rows, each with ten digits. The output is symmetric around the center, with the first half mirrored in the second half. For instance, Row 1 (\"1025005201\") is paired with Row 8, creating symmetry.\n\nIn the second example, a 5x4 input produces ten rows of eight digits. It appears that the output for Row 1 is a concatenation of input rows 1 and 2, with similar mirroring patterns occurring throughout the rows. This intriguing structure shows how the outputs relate to the inputs and confirms their consistency!**Finalizing grid output**\n\nFor the third example with input \"5533,\" I realize it has one row and four columns. According to the pattern, the output should be two rows with eight columns. I create the first output row by concatenating \"5533\" with its reverse, resulting in \"55333355.\"\n\nSince there's only one input row, the second output row duplicates the first, leading to the final output being two identical rows of \"55333355.\" This ensures everything checks out perfectly!",
