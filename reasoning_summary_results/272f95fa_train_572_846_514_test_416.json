    "reasoning": "**Analyzing block colors**\n\nI've created a map of colors for a 3x3 grid. The corners of the grid all have the same value of 7, while the center block has a value of 6. The edge values appear symmetrical, as they list clockwise around the center: 2, 3, 1, and 4. The top edge is (1,2) with 2, the right edge (2,3) has 3, the bottom edge (3,2) holds 1, and the left edge (2,1) is 4. The corners maintain the original color of 7.**Analyzing grid structure**\n\nI\u2019m working with a 9-column grid, and I\u2019ve confirmed the length of the first row is 9. The rows reveal 8's in specific places, particularly in rows 2 and 5, which are pure 8's. The vertical dividers show up in columns 5 and 7 based on patterns.\n\nI see three segments: the first segment has row 1, the second includes rows 3 and 4, and the last is row 6. I also need to fill the non-divider blocks with new colors while keeping the corners as zeros. The center block will be 6, top edge 2, right 3, bottom 1, and left 4.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI need to build a grid while preserving the structure. The divider rows (rows 2 and 5) will remain entirely filled with 8s, and the divider columns (5 and 7) will also stay as 8s. \n\nAs I fill in the blocks, the corners will maintain their original value of 0. The top middle block will get a value of 2, the left middle block will have 4, the center will be 6, and the right middle will be 3. \n\nAfter assembling the rows:\n\nRow 1: \"000082800\"  \nRow 2: \"888888888\"  \nRow 3: \"444486833\"  \nRow 4: \"444486833\"  \nRow 5: \"888888888\"  \nRow 6: \"000081800\"  \n\nI confirmed the output looks correct!",
