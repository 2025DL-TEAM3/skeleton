The input rows are indicated, and I\u2019m indexing columns from 0 to 8. \n\nFor instance, for column 0, I gather [6, 5, 2], which I can represent as \"652\".

So, my final T consists of these collected values for each column.**Reversing the rows**\n\nI\u2019m reversing the rows of the earlier output, where I assign the values accordingly. So, row 0 will correspond to \"227\", row 1 to \"222\", and it continues down with each new row representing the respective value in reversed order.\n\nThe final output creates a grid of 9 rows, each containing three digits.
