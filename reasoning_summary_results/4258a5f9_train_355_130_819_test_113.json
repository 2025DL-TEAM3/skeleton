    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input-output mapping**\n\nI\u2019m checking if the example holds up. The input has 2s, so should I be creating 3x3 blocks around each 2? It looks like, in the output, they didn't do that. They simply mapped 2 to 2 and 8 to 1 without drawing any blocks. \n\nThen I\u2019m looking at the second example: I see the input's dimensions and digits; they\u2019re mapping 5 to 1 and 6 to 6. It seems there are some inconsistencies in how values are transformed.**Assessing mapping consistency**\n\nI'm analyzing the mappings in the input and output. For specific columns, it looks clear where 6 maps to 6 and 5 maps to 1. However, when I check row three, I notice some inconsistencies. The output suggests 5 should remain unchanged in some instances, which seems off.\n\nThere appears to be a pattern where I might want to treat 6 as a key and place blocks around it, drawing a comparison to earlier examples. It\u2019s worth re-evaluating how I handle these mapping anomalies for consistency!**Examining the grid mapping**\n\nI'm analyzing the anomaly in row six and whether col4 connects to a 2 above it. The block around this 2 is tricky because it overlaps with a column that doesn't exist. It seems the pattern of filling borders may vary between examples. \n\nI think the general rule could be about detecting shapes formed by colors (like 2s or 6s) and mapping those borders. Some mappings seem to remain unchanged while others get a fill based on their neighbors. I need to confirm this hypothesis of marking neighbors of specific values through examination of the input grids.",
