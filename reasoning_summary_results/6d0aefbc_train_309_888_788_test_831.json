The input consists of sequences like 76 turning into 7667, which means I mirror the first digit at the end. \n\nSo for example, with the input 76, I split it as X=7 and Y=6, then combine them as XY YX. \n\nWhen checking the other examples, like 62 turning into 6226, it follows the same pattern. I see that the rule is to reflect the input numbers by appending their reversed string. It's consistent across all examples, showing that I can confirm the rules apply for different digits.**Applying the string mirroring rule**\n\nI'm looking at the rule now: for each input string, I need to concatenate it with its reverse. \n\nIf I have the input \"66\" on two lines, then I mirror it. So, 66 plus 66 results in '6666'. \n\nThat means for each input line, I output '6666', leading to two lines of '6666'. \n\nI\u2019ll format it correctly, ensuring I return exactly that.
