The cell at column 6, row 5 touches the right border, but I\u2019m unsure if it counts as border-touching. \n\nAm I interpreting the border rule correctly? Any cell touching the edges\u2014top, bottom, left, right\u2014should be considered touching, but that doesn't seem consistent here. Perhaps I need to consider if it's about the entire grid's periphery, or if it's based on the size of connected components. Let's investigate further!**Analyzing zero replacement rules**\n\nI'm examining the connected component sizes in the given rows. For instance, in row 1, the zeros at positions 4, 5, and 6 form a size 3 component but haven\u2019t been replaced. Meanwhile, size 1 and 2 components have been replaced, which isn\u2019t consistent. \n\nIt seems there might be differing rules for how zeros are treated at the edges versus within the row. I\u2019m puzzled about how trailing zeros are replaced or not across examples. It feels like I need to clarify this replacement criterion further.**Defining zero replacement criteria**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the rules for replacing zeros next to non-zero digits. It seems that zeros are often replaced with 1s, rather than matching their neighboring digits, which is somewhat inconsistent. \n\nThe replacements appear to be determined by the count of adjacent zeros and their relationship with non-zero digits. It looks like zeros sandwiched between non-zeros get filled, but those at the edges or in certain arrangements don\u2019t. I need to clarify this further by re-evaluating my examples.**Compiling output based on rules**\n\nI'm processing the rows to create a filled output based on the rules for zero replacement. For instance, in Row 0, the output is \"7111160\" after filling zeros adjacent to non-zero digits. \n\nRow 1 shows a similar fill pattern, resulting in \"7116157,\" while Row 2 outputs \"4818000\" since the zeros are flanked correctly. Row 3 remains unchanged as there aren't flanked runs, while Rows 4 to 6 reflect zero replacements based on their neighbors. I feel confident delivering this output grid!",
