The goal is to fill that missing cell with a new color. So, for example, if the base color is 6 and the fill is 1, I realize the 2s act as obstacles. I\u2019ll examine each 2x2 square to determine which color is forming these blocks while considering the layout. Let's clarify that relationship further!**Analyzing 2x2 blocks of colors**\n\nI'm examining the input to find 2x2 blocks with a certain configuration. In the first example, I see blocks of 6s or 2s, particularly around the coordinates (2,1) and (4,1). The first block by (2,1) has three 2s and one 6, so I can fill the missing cell with a 1 to complete a 2x2 block of 2s. I also need to check if other blocks have similar patterns, particularly around rows 4 and 5, ensuring I fill those correctly as well!**Finalizing grid output**\n\nI'm checking the block at (5,6) and realize it only has two fives, which is acceptable for this task. It seems that\u2019s good to go! Now I\u2019ll ensure I return the grid in the same format as before, maintaining the structure of the output. The final output grid looks like it's ready to be shared. Let's keep everything clear and consistent for the user!",
