Counting, row one has 2, row two also has 2, making 4 in total; row three and four each have 4, giving a total of 12. This indicates that each input cell scales to a 2x2 block, doubling both dimensions from 2x3 to 4x6. Each input cell (i,j) corresponds to a 2x2 block in the output, confirming the pattern.**Generating output grid**\n\nFor an input grid of size h x w, the output should be (2h) x (2w), replacing each input digit with a 2x2 block of the same digit. In this case, the input is a single row of 5 digits: \"19904\", making h=1 and w=5. Thus, the output height becomes 2 and the width becomes 10. Expanding each digit horizontally, I get the first row as \"1199990044.\" Since the second row is identical, the final output grid is:\n\n1199990044  \n1199990044",
