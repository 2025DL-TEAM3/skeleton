    "reasoning": "**Extracting values from grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a grid where columns 0 and 1 contain non-background digits (9 and 3), while columns 2 and 3 are background and should be removed. This means I extract 3 and 9, which flipped gives me \"39\". That works for other rows too, producing \"39\" repeated four times. For another example with numbers 4 and 8, I notice a rectangle formed by digits 8 and 2 in the grid. Flipping the non-background results fits my rules for identifying regions.**Finding the majority color**\n\nI'm thinking about how to simplify this task: I should find all colors in the grid and determine which one occurs most frequently. It seems like 0 is the majority in one example, 8 in another, and 4 in a third\u2014though the background color is likely the most common color.\n\nFor my calculation, I'll identify all cells that don't match the majority color, compute the bounding box, extract the relevant submatrix, and then flip it horizontally. After processing the input, the output should yield the rows \u201c85\u201d, \u201c55\u201d, \u201c55\u201d with no extra characters. That looks like a solid plan!",
