For instance, with the number 810003200, it looks like 3200 was added to something, but the output is showing a different addition. \n\nMaybe I should treat the input as a state and consider that the output involves sorting digits rather than straightforward arithmetic. \n\nIn another example, rows of 7-digit numbers seem to produce specific outputs based on the input, but it\u2019s unclear why certain numbers consistently yield the same output. I'll need to clarify the rules!**Analyzing input-output correlations**\n\nI've counted the input lines, and there are 9 in total. The outputs consist of the same number of rows, with the first input matching its output. In Row 2, the output shows a significant transformation, which is puzzling. I\u2019m trying to figure out if it involves some kind of digit rotation or subtraction from previous rows.\n\nMaybe the outputs represent a cumulative difference or merely retain significant changes. Row 3 reflects a case where no meaningful change occurs, resulting in the row output being the same as the input. I'll keep working to clarify the logic!**Exploring digit extraction rules**\n\nI'm analyzing digit patterns in the input and outputs. The outputs seem to take non-zero digits from each input row, but it looks like they preserve a fixed prefix from the first two digits. Each subsequent non-zero digit appears to be added based on a scanning strategy that might be from right to left, as seen in Row 4 and Row 5 outputs.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting that they skip values already extracted in previous rows, like the digit '5'. I'm still trying to grasp the full extent of the rule, especially concerning when to include certain digits, like '3' from earlier rows, and how everything gets sorted out!**Finalizing the output fill algorithm**\n\nI'm examining the legend array, which now includes the elements [2, 8, 6] based on the new values from the input rows. I'll fill in the output based on these legends by scanning for the rightmost unseen values.\n\nIt seems for each row, I'll check if the current row number meets the criteria based on the legend. The final output logically maps to 200 for Row 1, 260 for Rows 2-7, and 268 for Row 8. This approach appears consistent with my training, so I\u2019ll commit to this algorithm!",
