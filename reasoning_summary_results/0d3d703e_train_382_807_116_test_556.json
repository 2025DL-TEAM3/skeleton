    "reasoning": "**Mapping digit transformations**\n\nI'm working on a numeric puzzle that involves mapping input grids to output grids. The first training example gives me an input of nine rows and five columns with the digits. From the first row, \"45945\" translates to \"31831,\" suggesting a mapping where 4 becomes 3, 5 becomes 1, and 9 becomes 8. So far, I've established that only the digits 4, 5, and 9 appear in the inputs, while the outputs are limited to 3, 1, and 8. I'm curious about how to handle the remaining digits in the next training set.**Establishing digit mappings**\n\nI'm mapping digits from the inputs to their corresponding outputs. For instance, the input \"292249\" gives us \"686638,\" which leads to mappings like 2 becoming 6 and 9 becoming 8. Then, I see more examples confirming this, like \"842222\" mapping to \"936666,\" solidifying that 8 goes to 9. \n\nI'm getting consistent mappings for other digits as I explore through the datasets, but I also need to identify mappings for digits not previously covered. I'm sorting through a 10-row test input to transform it appropriately based on my established mappings, which should help me ensure accuracy across the board.**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI'm transforming the input rows using my established digit mappings. Each row is getting converted with the mapping confirming\u20145 becomes 1, 9 becomes 8, and 1 becomes 5. \n\nAfter processing all rows, I\u2019ve double-checked each transformation, ensuring the outputs are consistent. For instance, row 4 has transformed correctly into \"158185\". I\u2019m thrilled to see that all rows generate accurate results. The final output grid contains ten lines, confirming the mapping is solid throughout. Everything checks out, and I'm ready to present the results!",
