    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation patterns**\n\nI\u2019m working to figure out how the input transforms into the output across three training examples. It looks like the approach involves replacing specific numbers, especially near boundaries. For instance, in the first example, the input and output share many rows, but statements such as \u201c448884222\u201d in rows 5 and 6 changed to \u201c444444888\u201d indicate some replacement logic is at play. I need to ensure I properly analyze how the rows relate and how they differ in patterns or values.**Identifying number patterns**\n\nI\u2019m seeing that the transformation focuses on a block of two rows where specific numbers shift positions. In the example, the input has a series of '4's and '8's that get repositioned to make a new sequence. The '8's, which originally appear in the middle, move to the right end, while '4's fill the left portion. It seems like the '2's in the background are serving as a kind of placeholder. I'm really trying to visualize these patterns, especially in relation to the background and shapes.**Exploring zero transformation**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the role of zeros in the transformation from input to output. In row 1, zeros are introduced, but in row 3, the zeros get replaced entirely by sixes. It appears that zeros in certain rows are shifted toward the nearest boundary. For example, zeros at column positions are moved either to the left or right edges. It seems like the placement of zeros depends on their initial count\u2014rows with more zeros receive more attention in the output, while others might completely lose them.**Verifying output grid transformation**\n\nI\u2019m working on finalizing the output grid after applying punch logic. It looks like punching checks at various positions have led to adjustments, especially in regions with 'B' pixels. For example, in row 4, the columns 3-6 change to 6, with a punch effect at column 9 resulting in a final adjustment. Each row's integrity seems maintained, with careful attention to boundary and internal pixel interactions. With these final checks in mind, I think I've arrived at a plausible final output grid, presented neatly for clarity.",
