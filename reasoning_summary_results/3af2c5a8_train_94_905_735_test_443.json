    "reasoning": "**Inducing transformation rules**\n\nThe user provided three training examples illustrating the input-output patterns for task rules. To figure out the transformation, I need to work with the input \"437\" after analyzing the examples. In these examples, each input digit is transformed by repeating it horizontally as a two-digit string. The output forms a symmetric pattern where each digit forms a 2x2 block. This involves a sequence from 5 input rows leading to 10 lines in the output. Let's clarify how these patterns work!**Clarifying output structure**\n\nThe output consists of 10 rows created by repeating the input rows, duplicating them, and adding the reverse sequence. Each value in the rows is doubled horizontally, so the single digits appear twice in each row. For instance, an input of three rows of \"8888\" leads to six rows of \"88888888\" because each row is duplicated. However, the output example confirms that the sequence can appear symmetrical, leading to reflection in the overall structure. The final output maintains the length of 10 lines by effectively balancing reflected sequences.**Defining symmetrical outputs**\n\nAfter analyzing the initial block of four rows, I noticed that to create the final output, I need to append the reverse order of those rows. For instance, starting with the rows '9449', '1991', '3003', and '4444', I reverse them to get '[4444,3003,1991,9449]'. This gives the output a palindromic symmetry both horizontally and vertically.\n\nApplying this to the input \"437,\" I generate rows that also reflect this symmetry. The final output will consist of two identical rows of '437734'. Here's the final representation:\n\n437734  \n437734",
