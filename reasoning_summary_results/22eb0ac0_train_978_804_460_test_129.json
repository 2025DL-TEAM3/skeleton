    "reasoning": "**Evaluating filling rules**\n\nI\u2019m examining the behavior described in Example 1, where each row is scanned for specific conditions. If the first and last numbers are non-zero and match, the entire row is filled with that digit. However, if both ends are zeros, they\u2019re ignored and left unchanged. For instance, in row 1, the ends are zeros, so nothing changes. In contrast, rows with non-zero matching ends, like 1 in row 3 and 8 in row 4, get filled accordingly.**Analyzing row patterns**\n\nIn Example 2, I'm assessing the filling rules for rows based on first and last cell values. If they\u2019re equal and non-zero, the entire row should match that number. For Row 1, since the ends (4 and 7) don\u2019t match, it stays the same. However, Row 2 should have filled with 4 as both ends are equal. This suggests discrepancies in expected versus actual outcomes, indicating a pattern propagation across rows based on matched endpoints. In Row 3, non-zero patterns like 10001 appear uniquely, and zeros might be ignored in the pattern recognition process.**Examining stripe patterns**\n\nIn these examples, I\u2019m exploring how colored stripes in the rows fill cells. In Example 1, three distinct colored bars at the ends of rows are treated like horizontal stripes, and the rule seems to extend these colors across the respective rows. In Examples 2 and 3, rows with colored pixels at the ends define patterns that fill across all intervening rows. \n\nFor Example 2's Row 1, the presence of multiple colors leads to a pattern that replicates across rows. But the logic for filling seems to differ depending on whether gaps exist between colors, as seen in Example 1, where adjacent blank rows remain unchanged.",
