To find a rule, I need to analyze previous examples, like one with dimensions of 10x7 and digits like 0, 7, and 9, which produced an output of 7. It seems the output might relate to the majority non-zero digit. For another example with digits 0, 1, and 8, the output was 1. I'll keep exploring to clarify this pattern.**Identifying shape patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid where we're looking for patterns based on colored digits. The output appears to involve shape detection of the digits present. The zeros are the background, while other numbers create colored shapes. For example, in a grid with colors 0, 7, and 9, the shapes formed resemble the digits themselves, with 7s creating a \"T\" shape and 9s forming 2x2 blocks. In another example, with colors 8 and 9, it seems 8s create filled shapes while 9s are just markers.**Determining output color**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid to find the color forming the most significant pattern. It looks like the color that appears most frequently in the largest connected area is what we want. For example, with the digits 7 and 9, 7 appears more frequently, with a total count of 20, while 9 has only 8. This aligns with the earlier examples, where the minority color consistently has a count of 8. Therefore, in this case, the output would be 7, as it occurs more often.",
