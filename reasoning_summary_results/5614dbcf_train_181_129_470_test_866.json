    "reasoning": "**Analyzing training tasks**\n\nI need to focus on three training tasks and one test, aiming to learn a pattern rule. This domain involves ARC tasks, which often feature binary or pattern mapping. The inputs appear to be grids of digits, specifically a series of six lines with six digits each, while the outputs are numeric strings. For instance, the first example shows a 6x6 grid input with a resulting output of two lines, which could imply a classification or counting based on features within the grid.**Mapping the grid patterns**\n\nI'm breaking down the 6x6 grid. It seems there are two 3x3 patterns in the top-left and bottom-left. I want to identify the quadrants: the upper-left quadrant has a majority of 5s, but there's a central 8. The upper-right quadrant is all zeros, while the bottom-left quadrant has a varied 2-5 pattern, and the bottom-right is mainly 2s. It looks like I need to count specific numbers across these quadrants, with the first output of \"80\" possibly relating to the counts of 8s and zeros in the upper section, but I\u2019m not entirely certain yet.**Interpreting pattern outputs**\n\nIn the upper-left area, I see a pattern combining an encoded 8 with the majority color background of 5, while the upper-right consists solely of zeros. The bottom row output \"22\" likely corresponds to the two 2s from the bottom-left and right quadrants. For the next example, a 9x9 input suggests finding minority colors in 3x3 blocks. I\u2019m still trying to figure out how they determine output; it seems to rely on majority counts in most cases, which is leading to some confusion based on the previous example's output.",
