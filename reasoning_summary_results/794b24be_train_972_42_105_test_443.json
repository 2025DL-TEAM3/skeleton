    "reasoning": "**Analyzing bounding box mapping**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the input with a 3x3 block of ones, but it seems they want the top-left 3x3 region of the colored part instead. The frame displays 222,777,777, and the original input is a 6x4 grid with a rotated L-shaped region. It\u2019s mostly 7s, with a few exceptions. I think they want to create a minimal bounding box around the non-7 values and then map those unique numbers to simplified digits. The bounding box includes specific rows and columns that I need to crop and map to the new values.**Examining shape outputs**\n\nIt seems the task involves producing outputs by shifting shapes. I\u2019m checking the second training example, which consists of a 7x7 grid filled with '5's and some anomalies in specific positions. The anomalies occur at certain coordinates across rows, and when I list these, I see the data is structured into eight rows.\n\nThe goal might be to crop a bounding box around these anomalies, focusing on minimal rows and columns. It looks like they then output a representative 3x3 motif, consistently starting with \"222\" in the first row for all examples. I\u2019m curious about why that pattern appears across the outputs.**Exploring color mapping challenges**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand the mapping of colors from the grid. For instance, every '1' maps to '2', and every '3' maps to '5.' However, there is some inconsistency that complicates things, like the output indicating '1' maps to different values in different places.\n\nI notice simpler patterns in the first and third examples, with consistent outputs. It seems they might be creating a representative shape based on frequency among the unique colors. I need to check for commonalities in these patterns and how they transform the shapes into the final output. The anomalies in each example contribute to the shapes they want to generate.",
