I realized that to achieve this, I first need to transpose the original matrix. Then, I reverse the order of the rows\u2014this indeed confirms my 90-degree counterclockwise rotation! Testing it with an example confirms that the output aligns with this rotation rule. For an input of 8 rows and 6 columns, the output becomes 6 rows and 8 columns, effectively swapping their shapes.**Testing rotation calculations**\n\nI'm testing a rotation of an input grid. For the first example with rows 888778 and 787887, I'm trying to confirm that the output\u201487888888\u2014correctly corresponds to the last column of input when rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise. It looks like I'm on the right track since the calculations show it matches up correctly. \n\nIn a separate example with 9 rows in a single column, the output becomes a single row of 9 columns, also confirming the rules I identified for a 90-degree CCW rotation. Finally, I see that a grid of '2's with 4 rows and 10 columns will yield the same value in the rotated format, just reshaped.**Finalizing output configuration**\n\nI've determined that the output will be a grid of 10 rows, each containing the string \"2222.\" After applying the 90-degree counterclockwise rotation rule, I see that the number of output rows matches the input columns, which is 10, and the number of output columns matches the input rows, totaling 4. Each output row takes elements from the respective input columns, which are all '2's. So, the final output consists of 10 identical lines of \"2222.\"",
