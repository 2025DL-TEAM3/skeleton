The input consists of grids of numbers, like the example here with a 6x9 layout. \n\nThe first example shows that a 3x3 block was extracted, mainly consisting of '4's and '9's. I need to map the coordinates of this 2D array and see how they relate to the output. Observing the layout reveals the focused extraction amidst a background of mostly '2's.**Identifying grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a grid from the examples. It looks like there\u2019s an extraction of blocks based on unique distributions of values. For instance, if I have values like 2s, 3s, 4s, and 9s, I should isolate blocks that contain a distinct count of these numbers.\n\nIn the next example with a 10x10 grid, I\u2019ll check for a specific 4x4 block formed in the top-left, which mainly contrasts with the background filled with 7s. This pattern can help identify the smallest rectangles or bounding boxes of non-background color cells.**Examining grid extraction**\n\nI'm plotting input as a grid with a background of 2's and marking colored dots for 4's, 9's, and 3's. When I check their coordinates, it looks like they form an 'X' shape. I'll assess clusters to identify which 3x3 block corresponds to the goal pattern. \n\nThis leads me to consider symmetry and the distribution of colors within these blocks. Notably, blocks contain various distinct colors, but I need to determine which block to extract based on specific criteria, like the sum of values or structural uniqueness.",
