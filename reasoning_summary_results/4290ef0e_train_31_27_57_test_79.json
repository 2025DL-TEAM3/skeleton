From previous examples, it looks like the inputs are 9 rows with 10 columns, creating a surrounding border of 1s. \n\nIn the test input, it appears to be a true 9x9 grid instead of 9x10. I wonder if there's a missing trailing 1 that was trimmed off. Let\u2019s count the characters to confirm the dimensions and see if it's consistent.**Examining puzzle input**\n\nThe test input presents a 9x9 grid, which seems consistent in its rows and columns, although other examples used 10 columns. I'm wondering if there's been a mistake or maybe they just dropped a column. It\u2019s essential to focus on the structure since the input is 9 rows. Each output is a 5x5 grid, likely extracting patterns like detecting crosses or specific regions. \n\nExamining the first example reveals distinct patterns surrounded by numbers, leading to the conclusion that the output represents concentric shapes based on color mapping. Let\u2019s analyze it further.**Analyzing concentric rings**\n\nI\u2019m checking the input structure, particularly the first few rows and columns, focusing on identifying a ring of 7s around a center. The center appears to be at (2,2), but the surrounding elements aren\u2019t uniform, since (1,1) is a 4. Also, there might be concentric rings of different values, like a ring of 4 around a 7 or rings of 6 surrounding 7s.\n\nI need to establish which elements create these rings and confirm their sizes. The output should represent these patterns clearly, showing how I combine the smallest rings to create a structured 5x5 output with distinct rings and a defined center value. Let's keep investigating the details!",
