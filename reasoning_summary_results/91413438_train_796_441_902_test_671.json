Maybe it relates to the number of distinct colors, but there's a mismatch when comparing different examples. Example one has two colors, while example two also has two colors but a factor of 3. I'm considering whether it's the count of non-zero entries, the number of input rows, columns, or even the maximum digit in the input. I need to keep digging to find the exact rule!**Exploring row filling rules**\n\nI'm trying to determine how to fill rows based on a certain pattern. For the first example, it seems logical to repeat inputs across columns for rows less than 2. For the second example, even though I thought only the first three rows would fill, it looks like all rows up to six filled, leaving the last rows as zeros. This suggests a different rule \u2014 maybe based on the number of non-zero entries. \n\n I wonder if it's about how rows are counted or the maximum unique row count, as the second example has that distinctness in its rows. It's tricky to pinpoint!**Analyzing tiling rules**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand how to fill rows based on a tiling rule. For examples one and two, it seems both involve repeating the input dimensions, but example three doesn't fit that pattern since it leads to an unexpected output size. It looks like it might demonstrate an edge-case where tiling stops upon reaching a zero. \n\nFor my test input, I\u2019ll assume I\u2019m tiling horizontally and vertically based on the dimensions, which might create a 6x6 output. It seems risky to rely on example three, so I'll stick with the consistent rules from the first two examples and see how it plays out!**Defining output dimensions**\n\nI'm thinking that a plausible rule is to repeat the input in a square pattern. For example, if the input is 2x3, then the output dimensions likely follow a pattern based on the input area. This would mean the output should be a 6x6 grid. The output can be filled by repeating the input using the dimensions of the input. \n\nFor my test case, this means I'll create the output as 202202, 002002 quite consistently, like the other examples. Given that examples one and two follow this well, I'll ignore example three as it might have an error.",
