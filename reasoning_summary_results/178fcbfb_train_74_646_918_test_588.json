    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit mapping**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a set of inputs where I need to create a mapping based on the frequency of each digit. For instance, in the first row, 441 has two 4s and one 1, which leads to the output 111 since 1 is less frequent. Similar patterns for the other rows show that the least frequent or smallest digit is chosen to fill the output. I'll break down how each row corresponds to the outputs based on their digit counts to identify this mapping clearly.**Investigating row outputs**\n\nI'm analyzing the output for Row5 where 344 outputs 333 because the unique minority is 3. In contrast, for Row4, 244 outputs 242 instead of 222, which feels inconsistent. The structure involves filling positions based on the original numbers, keeping the central 4 while replacing others with 2s, maybe to highlight a special property of that center position. I'll have to consider how each row relates to others and why certain positions result in these unique outputs, especially when they differ from the patterns of uniformity seen in other rows.**Understanding replacement rules**\n\nLooking closely at the rules for replacing colors in the rows, I see that in Row5, where the input is 424, we end up with 422 because the rule seems to keep majorities while filling with minorities. The first occurrence of a majority stays, and the others are replaced. It\u2019s intriguing that in rows of uniform colors, like 444 to 422, they maintain the first while altering the rest. The concept of treating the global context for determining minorities adds complexity. It appears consistent that for multiple occurrences, the first is preserved. For ties, the smallest value is chosen as the minority.**Analyzing row patterns**\n\nI'm realizing that the output for Row5 follows the same pattern as uniform rows, suggesting that rows with only median seeds act like those without seeds at all. In Example 2, rows with seeds determine how I fill others, such as filling uniformly. I see that maintaining the median in columns is essential for determining positions in the output. For various rows, I notice consistent patterns around majorities and fillings related to their characteristics. Overall, I've grasped a clearer understanding of how seed placements influence the outputs, especially with uniform row behavior.",
