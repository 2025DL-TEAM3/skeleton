I\u2019m writing out the rows as strings for clarity, like: B0 is \"2622535922\" and B1 is \"2229225226,\" and so on. I think I may have miswritten B6 at first, but I\u2019ve double-checked. The digits are confirmed as \"2992222355,\" so that looks correct now! Everything seems good with my matrix strings after this careful review.**Examining grid transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the rows of grid B, starting from B7 to B9. It looks like the structure is divided into four quadrants. The top-left quadrant matches the input A, which is good! Now, the top-right seems to be the reverse of a specific column from A. Specifically, B\u2019s top-right is a 90-degree rotation of A. Each entry in this quadrant corresponds correctly to my mapping. I\u2019ll continue to validate the rotation for the full 5x5 matrix to ensure everything holds up.**Filling matrix B**\n\nI\u2019m computing values for matrix B based on the original matrix A, filling it in systematically. For instance, B[2][2] corresponds to A[1][1] and equals 5, and similarly for other values. Once filled, I check to ensure that the rows in B correctly represent parts of A, with some being rotations. Each quadrant checks out: the top-right is a 90-degree rotation, while the bottom-left and bottom-right quadrants also align properly with expectations. So the finalized B looks good!",
