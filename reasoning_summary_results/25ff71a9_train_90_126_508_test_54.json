For example, in one case, output row1 equals input row0, and this pattern continues downwards, with the last input row possibly lost. It seems like I'm establishing a rule where each output row reflects the previous input row.\n\nIn a separate example, all six input lines also result in six output lines, highlighting a consistent pattern. I'm noticing how this mapping works, particularly with the structure of input and output relationships.**Finalizing output rows**\n\nI'm mapping output rows based on input rows, finding a clear pattern. For example, each output row from 0 to 5 equals the first input row, giving six 44s. Rows 6 to 9 follow different values. Specifically, I'm noting input rows of 0 to 4 are consistently 44, which aligns with the output.
