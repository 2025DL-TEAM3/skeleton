    "reasoning": "**Assessing 8s Movement Towards 3-Block**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how 8s move in relation to the 3-block. When looking at the distance, the 8 at (1,7) moves to (2,7), reducing the distance from approximately 3.6 to 2.8, indicating it\u2019s getting closer. Similarly, others also show a decrease in distance after moving. It seems they push one step toward the 3-block. I\u2019m curious where the cluster of 8s in row 7 originates from. Did they come from row 5?**Exploring Movement Dynamics of 8s**\n\nI\u2019m considering how an 8 might become an anchor when adjacent to the 3-block, generating a symmetric pattern. Maybe instead, each of the three distinct 8s simply moves one step toward the center. If two overlap, perhaps a new 8 appears symmetrically. In row 7, I see two 8s, but their origin puzzles me. Could one be from (4,2) moving right? It\u2019s possible they leave a clone behind, similar to how 1s and 9s move in training1.**Analyzing Movement Towards the 1-Block**\n\nI'm delving into the movement patterns of the 8s towards the 1-block. The 8s appear to move one step towards the block's center. For example, the 8 at (2,1) correctly moves to (3,2), and the one at (4,1) moves to (4,2). I\u2019m trying to figure out the diagonal movements as diagonal moves seem not allowed. However, it seems they prioritize horizontal movement when the distance is greater in that direction. The 8 at (10,3) moved two steps up to (8,3), but that may not be adjacent to the block. I need to clarify how adjacent positions are defined.**Calculating New Positions for the Grid**\n\nI'm analyzing positions for a grid transformation. Several positions are clamped within certain bounds to ensure they fit within acceptable limits, like (2,1) becoming (4,3). After adjusting positions, I compute unique new coordinates where values of 2 will go. I've identified new positions for rows 4, 5, 6, and 7, resulting in an output grid filled with static and movable blocks. Each row's contents are carefully derived to maintain the grid's structure while incorporating new values. Finally, I have formatted the output for easy reading.",
