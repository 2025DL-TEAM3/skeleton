The first three examples show that inputs like 9x9 and 9x8 yield 5x5 outputs, while 9x7 translates to 5x4. The inner shape seems important, and I've noticed a pattern forming. For instance, the 5x5 output appears to crop the border surrounding the central pattern. I'm digging deeper into the examples to clarify this extraction process.**Determining non-border values**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the input, which has borders made of 6s. To uncover the inner pattern, I\u2019d remove the outer two rows and columns of 6s, focusing on rows 3-7 and columns 3-7. I\u2019m identifying non-6 values to understand the shape formed by numbers like 2, 9, 5, and 7. The goal seems to be finding the largest hollow shape inside and how it relates to the output. I\u2019ll also check the second example closely to confirm the pattern.**Examining input examples**\n\nIn the second example, I found that the input consists of 9 rows and 8 columns. The output appears to be a 5x5 grid that crops around the 8 region, surrounded by 5\u2019s. I\u2019ve noted that the central 3x3 pattern in the output aligns with the upper-left 3x3 section of the input. The overall goal seems to be defining a central area with a distinct color, enclosed by a border of another color. I'll refine my understanding of this pattern further.**Validating row outputs**\n\nI\u2019m working through the output grid, confirming that the rows are constructed correctly. For example, row 2 is determined from the previous row, and I\u2019ve compiled the outputs step by step for clarity. I\u2019m checking for consistency with the original input, focusing on the anomalies around the key values. \n\nI also manually inspect rows 4-8 to visualize the surrounding frame that contributes to the final output. This careful examination helps ensure everything aligns properly, and I end up with the verified grid.",
