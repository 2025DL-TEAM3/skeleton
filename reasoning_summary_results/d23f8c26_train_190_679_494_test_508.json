    "reasoning": "**Analyzing numerical grid transformation**\n\nI'm examining a puzzle that maps numeric input grids to output grids. Each output grid maintains the same shape as the input. For instance, the first example has an input of 10 rows and 5 columns, while the second has 10 rows and 3 columns, and the third features 9 rows and 7 columns. It looks like the task involves replacing all non-majority digits with a base number, specifically 4 in most cases. This notable pattern appears throughout the output rows.**Deciphering grid transformation rules**\n\nIn this grid puzzle, most digits are replaced with 4s, but certain positions retain numbers based on specific rules. For example, in row 4, \"44979\" becomes \"44944,\" preserving the 9 but changing the 7 to a 4. It appears that the output maintains some digits while converting others to 4s. The digits 7 and 9 are sometimes kept in their positions if they form a repeating pattern. I\u2019m considering if the majority digit in each column is prioritized for preservation.**Identifying grid transformation rules**\n\nThe task involves figuring out how certain outputs retain specific digits while replacing others with a common number, specifically 4. In the first example, only the values in the third column are preserved when they are not 4s, resulting in the rest being converted. For the second example, a similar pattern emerges, with one column's values retained. It appears the rule is to identify a unique vertical stripe and set all other columns to the most frequent digit.",
