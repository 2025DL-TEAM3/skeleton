In the first example, there\u2019s a predominance of the color 3 over the color 4, suggesting current vs. older states. Moving to the second example, I'm checking counts for colors 5 and 0, thinking there are more 5s since 0s are less frequent. Then in the third example, I note that color 2 is more frequent than 7. Ultimately, I'll find the most frequent color as the background and determine a mapping for the colors. Time to parse the grid!**Counting grid colors**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a grid with 5 rows and 6 columns, focusing on color occurrences. I've counted how many times color 9 appears across all rows, totaling 23 occurrences, while color 7 appears 6 times and color 2 just once. This indicates that color 9 will serve as the background since it's the most frequent. I\u2019ll map color 7 to color 2 and color 2 to color 9. So, my output grid updates accordingly, resulting in a final structured layout that reflects these mappings.**Verifying output grid**\n\nI noticed I had listed \"922299\" for row 4, so I want to double-check that. Let\u2019s clarify systematically: \n\nFor row 1, it\u2019s \"999999\"; row 2 gives \"992299\"; row 3 shows \"992999\"; row 4 confirms \"922299\"; and row 5 concludes with \"999999.\" \n\nI\u2019ve double-checked each row's mapping, and, yes, they all fit together. \n\nSo the final output is indeed:\n\n999999  \n992299  \n992999  \n922299  \n999999\n\nEverything seems correct!",
