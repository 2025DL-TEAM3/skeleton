    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle grids**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle where I have to map an input grid of digits to an output grid of the same size. The first dataset contains a 9x10 grid with corresponding output also as 9x10. The second is an 8x8 grid of digits, and the last one is a 7x8 grid, both with matching outputs. It seems that the mapping may depend on independent rules per cell, possibly involving counts of neighboring digits or specific patterns.**Verifying dataset mappings**\n\nI noticed dataset 2 actually has 9 rows, although I initially thought it only had 8. The input contains lines from 52852299 to 29259693, confirming those 9 rows. The output for dataset 2 also has 9 rows, each with 8 columns. The mappings seem consistent with digits translating from input rows to output rows. As I explore dataset 3, it appears I might be using the same mapping logic, so I'll verify that it fits with outputs in the same way.**Applying digit mappings**\n\nI've established a digit mapping for datasets, noting how digits correspond to each other: 1 to 5, 2 to 6, 3 to 4, and so on. Interestingly, 7 and 0 seem unused, while 4 and 6 map consistently. I'm confirming that this mapping is invertible, meaning applying it twice returns to the original number. Now, for my specific test input, I can transform each digit, yielding new rows according to established rules. I'll double-check the output to ensure everything is correct.",
