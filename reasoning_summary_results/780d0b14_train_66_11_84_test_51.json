It seems like the transformation process might summarize counts from the input grid, which has 7 rows and 8 columns filled with digits 0-9. The resulting output has 2 rows and 3 columns. I wonder if it reflects the count of each digit from the input. To confirm, I'll start counting the occurrences of digits like 1 and 9 to see how they fit into this transformation.**Counting digit frequencies**\n\nI'm analyzing the input grid made up of digits across 7 rows and 8 columns. My goal is to tally up how many times each digit appears. For example, I see that digit 0 shows up twice in the last row, while 1 appears 32 times overall when I check each row. I also notice counts for digits 3, 6, 8, and 9. The output will reflect the most common digits, possibly displayed in two lines. I\u2019m curious about the specific function generating this output!**Exploring shape clusters**\n\nI'm considering how the digits in the input grid could represent shapes, where the 9s might form an outline while the 1s fill the inside. It looks like the top rows contain clusters of 9s forming a border, with the 1s as the interior shapes. I wonder if the output digits reflect these regions, where each column relates to a distinct shape, with specific colors denoted. The last row seems to indicate the interior colors of those shapes. It's like a puzzle, and I\u2019m keen on cracking this visual representation!**Summarizing output determination**\n\nI\u2019m confirming the output grid: the first row should read \"05\" and the second \"84.\" It looks like I need to check the clusters in row 7 and row 8 to ensure they meet the criteria, but since row 6 has the first valid cluster, it stands out as the sentinel. Row 7 does contain clusters, but they don't influence the earlier detection. The outputs maintain leading zeros, similar to previous examples. Thus, I\u2019ll finalize the output as two lines: \n\n05  \n84",
