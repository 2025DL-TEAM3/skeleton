    "reasoning": "**Analyzing shape patterns**\n\nI\u2019m noticing there seem to be two central 5s, but actually three rows: the first has [5, 5, 5], and the others have patterns with 0s and 5s. In the second example, it becomes evident with 555, 050, 050. \n\nLooking at the third input, the output shows a mirrored shape, forming an L pattern with a vertical line on the rightmost column. It seems that detecting the shape's orientation relies on certain features from the input, which I'll need to clarify more.**Mapping shape patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the input for patterns, focusing on the digits '5', '0', '2', and '7'. In the first example, I've identified three '5's located at (2,2), (5,4), and (6,8), and when plotted, they appear to form an L shape, but they aren't collinear. \n\nFor the second example, the input consists mainly of '0's and '2's. Mapping out where the zeros are shows a diagonal formation. However, the dense number of zeros makes it tricky to define a clear shape. I'll think more about how to categorize the colors to spot distinct patterns.**Analyzing shapes and coordinates**\n\nI\u2019m thinking the largest contiguous region of zeros might form a shape, and I'm considering the '5's in the examples as possible markers indicating the center of those shapes. For example three, I've identified multiple '5's and their positions. \n\nIn looking at colors and their frequencies, it looks like '3' is the most frequent, suggesting it might be the background. I\u2019m mapping out the shapes formed by '7's and '4's and finding that their outputs may reveal transformations of the shapes. This process involves finding bounding boxes, orientations, and perhaps completing incomplete shapes, leading to a fuller representation in the final output.",
