The outputs mirror the inputs, except for certain cells that change according to a specific rule. To solve it, I\u2019ll compare the input and output pairs to infer that rule. \n\nFor the first training pair, the input grid has 7 rows of 5 digits, and I noticed one change in row 7, where a 5 became an 8.**Deciphering digit transformations**\n\nI\u2019m digging into the patterns of transformations in the digit rows. In Row 1, I see the output changes only one digit, swapping 8 for 5. In Row 2, multiple digits change: 8s at various columns become 5s, which suggests a swapping pattern. \n\nRow 3 shows three consecutive 8s replaced with 5s, indicating perhaps a rule where sequences of three identical digits transform. In Row 4, all 8s also switch to 5s. This may hint at consistent replacements based on digit counts or positioning.**Identifying the swapping rule**\n\nI\u2019m examining the digit transformations and trying to understand a potential swapping rule for 5s and 8s. In Row 1, it seems like an 8 turned into a 5, and in Row 2, several 8s changed to 5s while a 5 turned into an 8. I confirmed similar patterns across rows.\n\nIn Row 3, six 8s are replaced by 5s, while Row 4 also swaps with no 5s initially present. After testing with a new input grid, it looks like the rule is to swap 5 and 8 whenever found.",
