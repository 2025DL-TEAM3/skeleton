When I align them, I see that the merged output takes the two distinct 1s and averages them, resulting in ones at both positions. \n\nThen I look at the next pair: 117717 and 777777, where the output remains 117717. I\u2019m trying to make sense of how these inputs merge and what rules they follow. It\u2019s interesting to unravel!**Understanding merging rules**\n\nI'm analyzing the logic behind merging rows. For example, in row pairs, I see that when one row has 1s and the other has 7s, the output combines elements based on their positions, effectively taking the union of non-majority colors. In the first dataset, it focuses on the color 1, merging wherever the \"odd\" color appears. \n\nMoving to the second dataset, even with an odd number of rows, I see changes in specific rows while others remain constant. It\u2019s interesting how these rules apply!**Deciphering merging patterns**\n\nI'm trying to understand how directions are determined between 1 and 6 blocks in the rows. It looks like the arrows might indicate how to fill numbers in, depending on their positions. \n\nIf a 6 appears before a 1, the filling might go away from the 6, while if it\u2019s after, the filling goes toward the left. I'm realizing the relationships between rows can define merging patterns, and I suspect the examples might come from the same rule even if they seem distinct at first. Let's figure out how they all relate!",
