    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input transformation**\n\nI'm looking closely at the three training tasks from ARC, where inputs are grids of digits, and the outputs transform according to hidden rules. This particular input appears to follow a pattern, especially noticing anomalies in certain rows. For example, row 5 changes from 4224 to 4334 in the output, while row 6 switches from 3333 to 3223. It seems like the anomalies are creating a mirrored effect, particularly since row 7 retains its value. There\u2019s definitely a pattern here that warrants further exploration!**Understanding grid transformations**\n\nIn the second sample, I'm noting a pattern where certain inputs transform while others remain unchanged. The input grid shows anomalies in specific rows, like changing 9098 to 9898, while 8788 turns into 8088. It looks like inputs reflect around a certain symmetry. For instance, in row 6, the output matches the input, suggesting it remains unchanged. The anomalies actually seem to shift their positions while some numbers stay stable. This reflects a deeper symmetrical relationship in the grid transformations.**Decoding the transformation approach**\n\nI'm considering how the sequence might have been rotated by a certain amount, looking for a specific value where the rotated input equals the output. It seems the methodology involves altering the borders of specific rectangular shapes, possibly changing colors instead of rotating values. \n\nI see that in sample one, the outer border values are primarily adjusted to match a consistent color, while the interior is filled with a next color. Sample two appears to focus less on filling the interior uniformly and instead retains existing patterns but shifts them inward. Sample three continues this theme of moving subgrids inward. I'm intrigued by these transformations!",
