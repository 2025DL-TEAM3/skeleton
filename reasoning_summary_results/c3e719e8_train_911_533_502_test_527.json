    "reasoning": "**Analyzing scaling factors**\n\nI'm digging into the puzzle here, and it looks like I may be missing a line. The first training input is a shape of 3 rows by 2 columns, leading to an output of 9 rows by 4 columns. The next input also follows the scaling trend: 3 rows by 3 columns yields 9 rows by 9 columns. It seems there\u2019s a consistent scaling pattern where rows multiply by 3, but columns need further evaluation. I want to clarify this scaling factor!**Understanding output patterns**\n\nI'm examining the relationship between input columns and output columns. For a 3-column input, the columns expand to 9, which suggests a factor of 3. However, for a 2-column input leading to 4, that\u2019s an inconsistency because 2 multiplied by 3 would be 6. I\u2019m starting to notice that the output\u2019s column count relates to the input's shape: the outputs consist of 9 rows organized into blocks that resemble the input, expanding each cell into more detailed rows. It\u2019s fascinating to uncover this layout!**Visualizing output grids**\n\nI'm analyzing the expected output grid, which is 9 rows by 4 columns. This reshapes nicely to visualize blocks from the input. It really seems like I can organize the output into 3x2 blocks based on the input dimensions. However, the block size is influenced by the input, meaning each output cell corresponds to an expanded version of the input. \n\nNow, when examining specific blocks, it appears that certain blocks replicate entire input rows while others contain zeros. This hint at a more complex mapping process than simply mirroring the input values. I want to clarify how the algorithm determines what gets filled in each block!",
