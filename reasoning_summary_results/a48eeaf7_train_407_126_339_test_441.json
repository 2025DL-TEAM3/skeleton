    "reasoning": "**Defining movement rules for elements**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how elements move based on their positions relative to a block of 3's. Moving from (3,2) to (3,3) means a right move, keeping the same row, while also getting closer to the center. When looking at (7,2) to (6,3), it's moving up and one column right. I notice the rule: non-blocking elements should shift one step towards the block in both row and column, adjusting diagonally if needed, to better align closer to the center.**Analyzing block patterns**\n\nI\u2019m checking the input for training2, focusing on a block of zeros and the presence of 8s around it. The block of zeros appears to be a 5x4 shape spanning rows 3 to 7 and columns 3 to 6. I see that in row 1 we have four 8s positioned at columns 1, 4, 6, and 8. Later rows have varying occurrences of 8s. In total, I count 11 instances of the number 8 across the input and compare that to the output's location of 8s, noting patterns and possible movements.**Examining row structures**\n\nIn row 4, I notice the block at columns 3, 4, and 5 are marked with 7. The resulting row looks like \"007770000.\" In row 5, there are also markers and the same block pattern, giving \"007775000.\" Row 6 mirrors row 4, while row 7 shows some markers but no block, resulting in \"050050000.\" Row 8 has no markers. Overall, the grid now consists of 8 rows, indicating that everything checks out. I\u2019ll ensure that the output is properly formatted with 8 lines.",
