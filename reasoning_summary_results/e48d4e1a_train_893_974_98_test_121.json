The input has a long vertical line of 5's, but each row features a single 5 in the center, creating a vertical line of 10 rows. There\u2019s also a horizontal line of 3 consecutive 5's in row 7, forming a T-shape. At row 2, I notice an 8 causing a dent while row 2 has a horizontal extension. So, there are interesting shape formations to consider with these details!**Decoding shapes and orientations**\n\nIt seems I'm analyzing a grid for shapes. At row 2, there's an 8 at position (2,1), showing an extension to the left; at row 7, there are cells with 5's forming a horizontal bar. This T-like shape appears to have rotated into a Y shape. I observe distinct colored shapes: one vertical bar and one horizontal bar at row 7, and I need to find transformations for these shapes. Now, moving to Example 2, it\u2019s a 4x5 matrix displaying a plus shape of 9\u2019s!**Analyzing shapes and transformations**\n\nI\u2019m examining some shape structures in a grid. The output shows a vertical line of 9's moving from column 4 to 5, with a horizontal line at row 4. It seems the plus shape rotated and adjusted its center from (3,4) to (4,5). Analyzing the arms, it looks like they mirrored or shifted the plus to touch the bottom right corner. \n\nIn the next example, a grid with 2's and an 8 shows a horizontal bar of 8\u2019s at row 5, and a vertical line of 8's in column 2. The shapes form a plus with a single pixel of color 7 attached at (4,1).",
