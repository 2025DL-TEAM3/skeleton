    "reasoning": "**Analyzing shape clusters**\n\nI'm figuring out the shape of clusters based on the input. It looks like the 7s form a triangular shape with positions at (4,2), (4,3), (5,1), (5,2), and (6,2). Row 4 has two at columns 2 and 3, while row 5 has two 7s, one at column 1 and another at column 2. \n\nFor the 5s, they\u2019re located at (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), and (6,9). I'm double-checking the positions to ensure they're accurate, and it\u2019s coming together!**Identifying cluster shapes**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the 5 cluster's shape, which isn't symmetric; it forms an L shape with positions at (4,8), (4,9), (5,8), and (6,9). The 7 cluster also has an L shape, but they might be oriented differently. The shape of the 7s seems to resemble an arrow, while the 5s appear as a mirrored version.\n\nWhen I map the 5 cluster relative to its bounding box, it shows a specific structure. For the 7 cluster, the bounding box is also clear. Both clusters reveal intriguing patterns when I break them down this way!**Exploring cluster reflection rules**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how clusters are reflected based on their bounding boxes. In example 1, the 5 cluster has a height greater than its width, leading to vertical reflection. The vertical blank space is equal on both sides, while the horizontal space varies\u2014I noticed that reflection choice might depend on cluster orientation. \n\nThe rule seems to be reflecting across the axis perpendicular to the longer dimension of the cluster's bounding box. I\u2019m figuring out specific axes for the reflections and checking where extra blank space exists. This is a fascinating pattern!",
