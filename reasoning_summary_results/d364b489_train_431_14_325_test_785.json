    "reasoning": "**Finding distances to zeros**\n\nI'm considering neighbor distances and noticing some inconsistencies with the output values. For instance, the output from (0,0) to (0,4) should ideally be 4, but it shows 1. It's possible there are other zeros in the grid affecting this. To get a better understanding, I'm listing zeros in the first input dataset. \n\nFrom the analysis, I've identified zeros at specific coordinates across different lines, which will help me determine the distance to the nearest zero for each cell effectively.**Analyzing distance and output patterns**\n\nI'm testing the output at (0,0) and comparing distances to zeros at various positions, noting that the computed distance is inconsistent with the given output. It might relate to counting zeros in rows or columns or perhaps using a digital root approach. \n\nI'm exploring the idea of calculating Chebyshev distances, yet the output still doesn't match expectations. Additionally, I\u2019m considering potential cluster labeling or a convolution of neighboring zeros, but none of these seem to fit. I\u2019ll compare it to additional examples to uncover patterns or mappings that could explain the transformations better.**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the third dataset, which primarily consists of the digits 9 and 5, and I'm considering the possibility of encoding techniques, such as run-length or shape-based methods. I'm noting transformations where digits are replaced, like the first row outputting the same, while changes occur in other rows. The zeros are absent, prompting me to think they might serve as obstacles or special markers. \n\nI'm testing the approach of calculating Manhattan distances to special cells, particularly targeting three as a significant digit in the second dataset. As I go through examples like treating 5 and 9 differently, I find I need to carefully assess how these distances and values interact in relation to outputs. It\u2019s quite complex!**Calculating Manhattan distances**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a grid and calculating distances, focusing on the Manhattan distance for each cell. I\u2019ve compared results and noticed some discrepancies between what I expected and the values produced. It seems the Euclidean distance might also play a role, but for this output, I\u2019m sticking with Manhattan.\n\nAfter recalculating rows, I generated a new grid based on these distances, adjusting where necessary for accuracy. I think the final results reflect the calculation well, even though I still have some doubts about specific entries. Nevertheless, here\u2019s the output I'm confident in.",
