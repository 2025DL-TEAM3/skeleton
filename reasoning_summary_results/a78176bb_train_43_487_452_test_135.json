    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit positions**\n\nIt seems that the digits 5, 6, and 3 are being repositioned based on the input's pattern. I\u2019m noting that the input has rows where these numbers form a diagonal line. The background color is presumably 7, while the foreground has 5, 6, and 3. \n\nI\u2019m tracking the coordinates for positions where the input isn\u2019t 7 and plotting the shapes they create. This might indicate a triangle or 4x4 block structure based on their specific locations.**Analyzing diagonal patterns**\n\nI'm trying to determine the positions of digits in the grid. It seems there are two diagonals being referenced. The primary diagonal runs from (0,2) to (5,7) and has six positions: (0,2), (1,3), (2,4), (3,5), (4,6), and (5,7). \n\nNow, there's talk of mirroring these positions across a centerline in the grid. I wonder if they're replacing triangles of 6 and 3 with symmetrical diagonals, while presenting outputs that consist of two diagonal lines. I need to list all output positions to clarify the patterns.**Exploring triangular patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid where there's an anti-diagonal from northwest to southeast. The 7s form a triangle on one side, while the 0s form a triangle on the other. It looks like each input creates a colored triangle overlay, dividing the square into two triangular halves. In example3, the diagonal of 2s separates these triangles. I need to tally the positions of the digits 2 that appear in the output, as they seem to create a mirrored diagonal pattern. It\u2019s a bit complicated, but I'm figuring it out!",
