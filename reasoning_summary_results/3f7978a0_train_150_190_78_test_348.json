It seems I counted 8 positions in total. \n\nNext, the output grid with digits 5, 9, and 7 looks like it\u2019s from the top-left corner of the input. Aligning the values, I see output row 1 is 5, 9, 9, 5, while input row 3 has those digits, but in a different arrangement. It feels like I'm trying to figure out the structure of this output versus the input coordinates.**Examining the output grid structure**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that the shape is like a 4x4 donut with corners of 5, 9s on the top and bottom, and 7s on the sides. \n\nAs I think through the positions, I recap that the output is: \n\n- Top row: 5,9,9,5\n- Middle rows filled with 7s\n- Bottom row also with 5s \n\nThen I realize this pattern reflects a symmetrical configuration. \n\nFor the next example, I need to locate a matching 5x4 subgrid from the input. I see that row reversals are at play, which complicates things a bit!**Identifying patterns and extracting shapes**\n\nI'm analyzing clusters of 5s near the shape, specifically noting that in rows 3 and 6, columns 2 and 5 have values of 5. This creates a 4x4 block with a 2x2 square of 9s surrounded by 5s. Then I see that within the training examples, there's a pattern of 34443 appearing multiple times, and it\u2019s important to find the minimal rectangle containing all significant patterns. \n\nI'll investigate how these segments connect, focusing on symmetric structures, and explore the adjacency of non-background cells to clarify the overall pattern.**Extracting and analyzing subgrid**\n\nI\u2019m starting with boundaries: row_start=1, row_end=4, col_start=3, col_end=6. When I extract the subgrid, I find:\n\n- Row 1 gives \"0660\"\n- Row 2 is \"4664\"\n- Row 3 repeats as \"4664\"\n- Row 4 returns to \"0660\"\n\nSo the output grid appears as:\n\n```\n0660\n4664\n4664\n0660\n```\n\nThis symmetric layout looks like a donut shape with 0s at the corners and 6s on the inside. I notice that the pattern is consistent throughout, preserving the leading zeros from the training output. It seems complete!",
