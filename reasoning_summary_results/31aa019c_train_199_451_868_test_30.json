    "reasoning": "**Counting anomalies in columns**\n\nI\u2019m examining how many non-5 values are found in each column from the given example. For Column 1, the non-5 rows are at 2, 4, 5, and 8, totaling 4 anomalies. In Column 2, I identify 6 anomalies at rows 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9. Column 3 has 3 anomalies at rows 6, 8, and 9. For Column 4, there are 2 anomalies at rows 5 and 6, while Column 5 shows 4 at rows 2, 6, 7, and 8. In Column 6, I find 5 anomalies in rows 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. Finally, Column 7 has anomalies at rows 2, 3, 5, and 9.**Analyzing anomalies in output**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that Column 4 only has 2 anomalies, which seems significant. When examining row 8, with the output \"5222555\", it appears to highlight anomalies, so I'm counting anomalies per column. Column 1 has 4 anomalies, but row 8 shows output as 5. Maybe row 8 indicates anomaly counts in specific columns? There seems to be a pattern in row 8 and row 9, suggesting they could reflect original input, particularly concerning contiguous clusters of anomalies. I\u2019m also considering how contiguous non-majority elements form distinct objects.**Drawing a 3x3 block**\n\nI\u2019m drawing a 3x3 square centered at (6,3), covering rows 5 to 7 and columns 2 to 4. I\u2019ll set those positions to 2, while returning the center (6,3) to its original digit of 5. The grid is 10 rows by 5 columns, mostly filled with 7s, except for the specified block, which will look like this: \n\nRow 5: [7, 2, 2, 2, 7]  \nRow 6: [7, 2, 5, 2, 7]  \nRow 7: [7, 2, 2, 2, 7]  \n\nI want to ensure that the original background color is preserved.
