    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid segments**\n\nI'm considering different examples of how endpoints in a grid define segments. In the first case, if endpoints are at columns 1 and 5, they drew cells in between, creating a center at column 3 with one cell on each side. For different endpoints, like in example 2, the cells drawn only reach to the center plus one on either side. In general, the idea is to take any two colored endpoints, identify the cells between them, find the midpoint, and then create a cross shape from there.**Defining the color change process**\n\nI'm focusing on how to change cell colors based on segment information. At the center coordinate, I need to change that cell's color to 3 and also modify the two adjacent cells along the segment's axis and perpendicular direction to color 3 as well. This creates a plus shape. In various examples, I ensure the center and its neighbors match the required logic. I need to find two differently colored cells, compute the midpoint, and apply the color changes accurately throughout the grid.**Calculating grid changes**\n\nI'm analyzing the input \"20002\" to pinpoint the colored cells. The colors at columns 0 and 4 are both 2, marking endpoints in row 3. Next, I compute the midpoint at (3,2) and change that cell and its four surrounding neighbors to color 3. I verify that these positions are valid within the grid. Once the changes are made according to the specified locations, I write the final output grid. It looks good, so I've got the formatting just right, with each row illustrated clearly.",
