I'm questioning which column should serve as the separator. For that, we want one with a unique background. Since the background is represented by 1s, and 3s are different, it looks like column 4 stands out as the separator with its unique color. This gives us a vertical split at column 4, clearly defining the left and right blocks.**Determining block dominance**\n\nI'm analyzing the blocks to see which one is dominant based on their background color. The left block has a consistent background color of 1, as does the right block. Since the left is established as dominant, I compare values. For row 1, column 2 and row 4, column 0 both have 5s, and in the right block, row 1, column 1 and row 5, column 3 both have 7s. This leads us to a final output.
