The rows provide a clear outline of rings, starting with the outermost ring formed by the border values from the first and last rows and columns.\n\nThe outer ring consists of values from row 1, row 8, and their corresponding corners. Notably, I see patterns emerging with the values being either 6 or 7. I'll map these ring positions into a list based on the indices where either rows or columns equal 1 or 8.**Identifying ring structures**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the values to uncover concentric ring structures. Starting with row 1, I note that the outermost ring contains values of 6 and 7. For the second ring, I see values 3 and 7 along with some zeros, particularly from row 3 and row 6.\n\nMoving to the third ring, I find values of 0, 3, and 6. Finally, the center, a 2x2 area, consists entirely of 6s. I\u2019ll summarize these as a six-digit sequence: 336633, reflecting the central structure outward.**Analyzing ring filling and dimensions**\n\nI\u2019m delving into the nested rings and zeros within the matrix. It looks like the innermost ring holds two zeros that might need to be filled with the outer color, possibly 6. However, the confusion arises around the output count; it seems there are discrepancies between the zeros and the printed results.\n\nI need to clarify the relationship between the layers and the output dimensions. There appears to be a method for deriving output shapes based on distinct color counts, but I\u2019m still trying to connect these observations comprehensively. I\u2019ve noted the output dimensions vary; it might relate to rings minus two but requires more exploration.**Reflecting hole shapes**\n\nI\u2019m working with a rule that involves reflecting holes horizontally and extracting the mirrored shapes. For the test input, I\u2019ll take the zero square from rows 2-3 at columns 1-2 and reflect it to rows 6-7 at the same columns. This means I\u2019m outputting a subgrid made of the values from those positions.\n\nThe shapes should be printed in a block format, so I expect the output to be two lines: \"35\" and \"58.\" I\u2019m confident about this process moving forward.",
