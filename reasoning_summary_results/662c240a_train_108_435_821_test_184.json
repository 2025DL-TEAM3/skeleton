    "reasoning": "**Solving grid patterns**\n\nI see that the task involves deriving output grids from given input grids, based on observable patterns from examples provided. Each input contains multiple rows and columns, and the outputs are smaller grids that seem to contain specific parts of the inputs. For example, in the first example, the output consists of the first five characters of each input row. I'll apply this logic to the new input, focusing on selecting possibly the first few columns or rows for the output grid.**Defining cut rules for grids**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to approach grid examples based on whether they contain zeros. For instance, if neither half has zeros, I might choose the left half by default. In another example, for a grid with more rows than columns, I\u2019d cut horizontally, whereas if there are more columns, I'd cut vertically. The goal is to select the half without zeros, and if both sides are clear or both contain zeros, I take the first half. It all seems to fit together!**Determining the output grid**\n\nLooking at the input rows, I see they represent a series of ten digits each. I can split them into two halves, the left with the first five digits and the right with the last five. After checking each half for zeros, I find that both halves contain zeros. Therefore, I\u2019ll default to the left half as my output. This gives me a 5x5 output grid consisting of the first five digits from each row, which is:  \n\n74503  \n44535  \n55505  \n03052  \n35524",
