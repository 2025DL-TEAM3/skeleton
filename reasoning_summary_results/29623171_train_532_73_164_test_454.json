For the bottom-right section, there seems to be a mix of values \u2014 a majority of 6s and a minority of 2s. The idea is to fill the top areas with the majority color and the bottom areas with the minority color, based on their positions relative to a horizontal line. I need to make sure I'm correctly identifying the prevalent colors in each quadrant and applying these rules consistently. Let's see how this plays out with the examples provided.**Defining grid structure**\n\nI'm analyzing a shape resembling a grid that forms a tic-tac-toe pattern, dividing it into 9 regions with two horizontal and two vertical lines. The task is to detect these gridlines and fill the sub-squares based on their positions. For various examples, I'm identifying specific feature shapes, like lines of 1s and 8s, that help define these quadrants. The next step is to figure out how to fill each block with the most frequent color or value, depending on their position relative to these lines.**Filling the grid blocks**\n\nI'm examining how to fill grid blocks based on the values in their respective regions. For example, the top-left block (0,0) holds a value of 6. Similarly, the top-right block (0,1) also has 6, which aligns correctly. For the bottom-left region, I'm considering whether to use the color from the adjacent junctions or reflect the colors of the top blocks. It seems rows above the plus shape should all take the color 6, while the bottom regions may opt for the minimum value of adjacent colors, leading me to fill those with 2 when necessary.**Determining block fills**\n\nI'm figuring out how to fill the blocks based on their contents. For instance, when a block contains the value 2 but is above the horizontal bar, it gets filled with 6 instead. The pattern seems to involve using the maximum value for top blocks and the minimum for bottom blocks, depending on their position relative to the bar. In different examples, I've noticed the system consistently chooses to fill with the larger or smaller label depending on whether the block is above or below the bar, but I need to make sense of these rules more consistently.",
