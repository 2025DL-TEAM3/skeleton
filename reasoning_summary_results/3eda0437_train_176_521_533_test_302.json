The task involves identifying the largest rectangular connected component of zeros\u2014should I consider 4-connectivity or 8-connectivity? In the examples I'm reviewing, only specific rectangles qualify for replacement. For instance, a 2x2 rectangle in one grid is valid, while others do not meet size requirements. This clarity helps in strategizing the replacements.**Identifying and transforming zero blocks**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to identify and transform blocks of zeros in a grid. For instance, in a specific example, I found a 4x2 block of zeros spanning rows 3 to 6 and columns 1 to 2, which I should replace with sixes. It's important to check the shapes and ensure only the relevant zeros are updated. This means rows 1 and 2 stay unchanged, while rows 3 to 6 will reflect the necessary replacements, leading to a clear, final output grid.",
