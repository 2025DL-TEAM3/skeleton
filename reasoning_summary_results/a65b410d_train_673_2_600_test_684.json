    "reasoning": "**Identifying anomaly shapes**\n\nIn this context, Row 7 has a 7 and the rest are 6s, making the 6s the anomaly. For the examples, ex1 has a shape of 4s, ex2 6s, and ex3 is made up of 0s. To clarify, anomaly shapes are contiguous regions of non-background color. For instance, in ex2, the contiguous shape of 6s spans from row 7, columns 1-5, making it a width of 5 and height of 1. In ex3, the shape of 0s is two in width and one in height.**Exploring filling rules**\n\nFor ex3, the filling above the shape uses color 1, while below it uses color 3. In contrast, ex1 and ex2 fill above with color 3 and below with color 1. This suggests a rule based on the shape's position: if it's on the left, I fill above with 3 and below with 1, and reverse for the right. Examining the examples confirms this: ex3 has its shape on the right, while ex1 and ex2 have theirs on the left. I'll apply this rule by detecting the shape's horizontal position and adjusting the fills accordingly.**Analyzing shape fills**\n\nWhen considering below changes, it seems I'm matching the shapes in ex1 and ex2 as being on the left. For ex1, with a width of 2, the expansions above in row 2 change 3 cells, and in row 1, 4 cells, while confirming ex2's width of 5 in similar rows shows all 6 cells altered. \n\nFor ex3, which has a width of 2 and is located on the right, I realize I need to adapt the fill formula since the previous approach doesn't give consistent results. The triangular fills differ based on the shape\u2019s position. I recognize that for shapes on the right, the contraction and expansion rules need reevaluation to ensure appropriate alterations.",
