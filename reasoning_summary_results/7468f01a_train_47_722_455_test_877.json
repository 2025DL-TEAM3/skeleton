But Row 5 reversing results in [4,4,4,7,7], while the example output has 44777. It seems the output example has three 7s. This mismatch is puzzling; the input had two 7s and three 4s, yet the output displays different counts. I think I'm noticing that it\u2019s not just about reversing but also altering the counts, which complicates things!**Analyzing row transformations**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about whether the rows are being rotated. When looking at example 1 with input 77444, I see that output row 2 is 44777. I\u2019m checking if this could be reversed or matched somehow. It seems the input columns might play a role, especially in the subgrid; however, nothing matches exactly when reversed or transposed. Maybe the output involves special handling of certain digits like 4s or 7s, but the reason for the mismatch in row 5 is still unclear.",
