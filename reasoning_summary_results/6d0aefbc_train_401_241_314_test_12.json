    "reasoning": "**Analyzing AR puzzles**\n\nI'm looking at an AR puzzle, and it involves transforming sequences of numeric strings into outputs. For example, the input \"700\" and \"007\" results in \"700007\" and \"007700,\" which is simply concatenation in both directions. In the second example, inputs like \"33\" become \"3333,\" as it mirrors around its center. Each output essentially doubles the input length by appending the reverse of the original string. This symmetrical rule seems to apply consistently across examples.**Exploring input-output rules**\n\nI'm examining a series of examples and how they transform inputs into outputs. For the input \"17111,\" reversing it gives \"11171,\" and combining them results in \"1711111171.\" This pattern holds consistently. In another example, inputs like \"700\" and \"007\" yield \"700007\" and \"007700.\" The key rule is that for each input string, I concatenate it with its reverse. This same logic applies across examples with varying numbers of rows and column lengths, reflecting symmetry in output. Each string just needs to follow this mirroring rule.",
