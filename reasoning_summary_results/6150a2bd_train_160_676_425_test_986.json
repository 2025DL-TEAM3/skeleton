I'm considering a 180\u00b0 rotation and testing it against the output. When I reverse input row 10, it matches the corresponding output row perfectly. However, when I try the same with input row 9 and its output, they don't match. I\u2019ll continue checking the positions for discrepancies to see if there's a consistent transformation that applies here.**Analyzing row transformations**\n\nI need to be careful with my reversals. Checking the positions reveals that the reversed order matches the output exactly for certain rows, confirming it's indeed a 180\u00b0 rotation. For the second example, I\u2019ll inspect the rows properly to ensure I note the matches between outputs and reversed inputs. The input for the second part provides a pattern similar to the first example, indicating a consistent transformation. I'll double-check each row to identify any errors in the mappings.**Validating row outputs**\n\nI\u2019m confirming that each output row accurately represents the reversed input rows. For instance, row 4 is correctly reversed to \"322272,\" and row 5 is \"222222,\" which matches as expected. Checking row 6 shows the input \"323337\" correctly reverses to \"773323.\" The outputs align consistently through all rows, and the final grid looks good. I\u2019ll focus on the nuances of reversing as characters, but it all seems to check out.",
