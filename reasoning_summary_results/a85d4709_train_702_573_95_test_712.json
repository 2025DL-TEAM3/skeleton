I wonder if I should consider mapping each digit differently or exploring the position of unique digits. For example, in 558, the unique digit 8 is at position 3. When I checked 585, the unique digit 8 also suggested position 2, but it outputs 4. I\u2019m exploring if it's about counting identical adjacent digits or something else.**Exploring digit mapping**\n\nI\u2019m identifying patterns among the rows of numbers. The output seems to depend on the position of unique digits, particularly the placement of the digit '6' or '8'. For example, with the row 556, the output is consistent when '6' is in a specific place. I see that positions correlate to outputs like 222, 333, and 444 as I analyze the logic. I also note the unique digit '0' in a different example, which seems to influence outputs as well. There's a systematic way this mapping occurs, but some outputs still feel uncertain.",
