    "reasoning": "**Counting Digits Carefully**\n\nI\u2019m trying to count the occurrences of digits in the sequence. Initially, I thought 5 appears eight times, but after checking closely, it\u2019s actually seven fives. I see that 0 shows up once and 9 appears twice, leading me to consider which digits are in the minority. With a new input, I recognize that the outputs change based on replacing the minority digits. For instance, the two zeros become nines, producing a revised output of 5599995555.**Clarifying Replacement Rules**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to replace digits based on proximity to a block of 9s. For each row, I'm expanding two 9s into three by changing nearby zeros. For the first row, the adjacent zero gets replaced with 9, and since there are no other zeros, it\u2019s straightforward. In the second row, the left zeros are farther, so they\u2019re replaced by 5 instead of 9. The third row has some tricky placements, where the nearest to the block goes to 9 and the farthest becomes a 5. The fourth row has no zeros, so it remains unchanged.**Analyzing Zero Replacement Rules**\n\nFor Row 5, I'm looking at the transitions where a zero at position 7 gets replaced with a 9 due to its adjacency to a 9 block. This seems to follow a pattern where zeros closest to the block are filled with 9s while others become 5s. In the previous rows, I see how the zero count impacts the extension of the 9 block. It looks like the extension length matches how many zeros are present, ensuring the 9s replace up to that number from the block's edges. It\u2019s a bit complex, but I think I\u2019m getting the hang of it!",
