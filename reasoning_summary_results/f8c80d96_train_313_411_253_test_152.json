    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input-output mapping**\n\nI'm breaking down the input \"555555515\" and noticing how the positions correspond. It looks like positions 0-6 are '5's, with position 7 being '1' and position 8 being '5.' That's odd since there's only one mapping for the input \"2\" leading to \"1.\" Both inputs are \"2,\" but one position offers a different output. When comparing the two grids, it seems like they both have 10 rows and 9 columns, indicating a more complex mapping with outputs showing variations like 1 mapping to 1 and 2 to 5, depending on the positions.**Evaluating input-output patterns**\n\nI'm examining the output for row 3, where the seventh column is consistently '1.' This suggests a rule where the second-to-last column remains unchanged in output, yet there's still some variability in the input for that column. It looks like the mappings generally hold, with '1' in the input mapping to '1' in the output unless it\u2019s in column 7, which leads to some exceptions. It\u2019s curious that this third example acts differently than the first two, which had a more uniform mapping structure.**Examining input-output shapes**\n\nI'm analyzing input3 and noting the 1s and 2s throughout the grid. It looks like a C-shape formed by the 1s with other 2s as background. I'm marking where the 1s appear and see a continuous shape, which then translates to the output where all other numbers become 5s, but the column 7 stands out with 1s. This suggests it adds a vertical line. \n\nThis may reflect a diagonal pattern not just from the input but could also signify a transformation. The input shows a zigzag pattern, possibly aiming to complete its form on the edges.**Mapping input values**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the shapes formed by input values and their frequencies. It seems there's a pattern where the more frequent value is mapped to 5 while the infrequent ones remain unchanged. For example, in some inputs, 2 is frequent, and 8 is infrequent, which leads to mapping 2 to 5 and keeping 8 as is.\n\nIn my new input grid, I confirm that 2 is the most frequent, hence I\u2019ll transform them into 5, while keeping the shape color (8) unchanged. The output grid reflects this mapping, so I\u2019ll present it now.",
