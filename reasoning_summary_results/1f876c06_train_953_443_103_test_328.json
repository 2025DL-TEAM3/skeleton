The sevens form a diagonal pattern, but the output shows five positions for sevens, while the input only had two, located at row 1, column 5 and row 5, column 1. I counted the input and confirmed it only had those two sevens. So, I\u2019m wondering why the output reflects more. It seems like I need to investigate further to understand the discrepancies between the input and output counts.**Understanding the Filling Rule**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to fill the path between two given digits, forming a diagonal line at a 45-degree angle. For instance, for the digit 4, the endpoints are at (1,4) and (4,1), filling intermediate positions. I notice a similar approach for 7s as well. There are also two 6s in the input, creating more filled positions along their diagonal. The rule seems to involve identifying non-background digits that appear twice. It's a bit complex, especially with varied rows, so I need to check carefully!**Constructing the Output Grid**\n\nI\u2019m filling in a grid by creating lines connecting two digits, specifically 6s and 1s in this case. The intermediate cells are being filled based on their slope. For example, for 6s, the endpoints are (1,2) and (4,5), with intermediates at (2,3) and (3,4). For 1s, the endpoints are (2,2) and (5,5). I'm checking for overlaps and ensuring everything is filled correctly without conflicts. The final grid output looks good and maintains the original structure!",
