I notice patterns in the deltas across rows, needing to confirm column-wise operations to identify any rules guiding the transformations. \n\nI need to ensure I grasp the overall structure accurately as I summarize these findings.**Exploring operations per column**\n\nI'm reviewing possible operations for each column across multiple rows. It looks like I\u2019m seeing patterns like +4, +1, -4, and -1, but they're not consistent per column. \n\nI\u2019m noting the input and output deltas for each operation, which might suggest a transformation based on neighboring cell values. \n\nAnother thought crosses my mind: could these operations relate to a keypad pattern or some digit mapping? I still need to check the second dataset to see if similar patterns persist.**Mapping digit pairs**\n\nI'm identifying mapping pairs in the datasets. For dataset two, I found pairs like 3->4, 6->2, and 8->9. I think these pairs seem consistent across multiple rows. Also, it's interesting to see some digits like 1 and 5 appear as interchangeable.\n\nThen, in dataset three, I\u2019m noticing more mapping pairs such as 1->5 and 2->6. It seems there\u2019s a global mapping where digits swap based on a defined pattern. I\u2019ll apply this mapping to the test input for a consistent output.",
