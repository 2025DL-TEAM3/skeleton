    "reasoning": "**Verifying transformations**\n\nI'm checking the conditions for changing 9s to 4s in even rows and columns. For coordinates like (2,2), (2,4), and others, I confirm if there are 9s at those positions, and I've documented that they change accordingly. The overall rule is any 9 in an even row and even column becomes 4, while others stay the same. Now, with the given example, I need to ensure that other numbers like 7 are also assessed for possible changes too.**Analyzing input changes**\n\nI'm reviewing the input positions of 7s to see which ones changed. In row 1, there were no changes, while in row 2, the 7 at (2,3) changed to 4. It seems like here, I need to differentiate between even and odd indices based on the rules. Later rows also reveal that some 7s, like those at (4,5) and (6,2), changed, while others, like (6,1), did not. So it looks like 7s are changing based on varying column parity across even rows.**Identifying change patterns**\n\nI\u2019m exploring how changes occur in the grid's even rows and columns. For the examples, I see that 7s in certain locations changed according to the row and column indices. It appears that there\u2019s a periodic pattern based on zero-based indexing. I want to find a consistent rule across examples, especially since there's some variation in which 1s change in Example 3. I suspect some changes might only apply to interior values rather than borders. This observation creates a need to identify which specific 1s are targets for change.",
