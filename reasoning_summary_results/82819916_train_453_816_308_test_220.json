    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a grid of digits and how the output alters certain rows. In the first training example, row 1 changes from 2222207 to 0070007, but it's not a straightforward reversal. Multiple zeros replace various positions, and the seven shifts to positions 3 and 7. In row 8, the original values change their positions, too, which is intriguing! I wonder about the consistent mapping pattern that governs these changes. Let's dive deeper!**Examining row transformations**\n\nThe output for row 8 turned out to be the same as row 6, both being 9949994. That\u2019s fascinating! For row 1, which transforms to 0070007, I\u2019m not seeing any identical original rows. I wonder if there's a pattern regarding rows with unique counts. The first and last rows change to reflect non-2 digits. \n\nLooking at the second example, rows with less frequent patterns replace the more common ones, suggesting there's a logical mapping based on occurrence frequency. It's all so interesting!**Exploring row transformations and mappings**\n\nThe thought revolves around figures in rows, where row 6 has a notable pattern of 9s and 4s. I see that rows 1 and 8 need replacements based on this. For row 1, it's transformed into 0070007 by mapping positions of 4 in row 6 to the value 7 in row 1. Meanwhile, row 8 copies from row 6 directly. Each transformation involves a unique operation. There seems to be a consistent pattern in how figures are mapped - I need to find a unified approach for all examples. It's intriguing!I'm analyzing how to map specific rows based on unique patterns in a grid. For instance, when column 3 has values 4 and 2, rows 1 and 8 get different outputs than expected. But in examples 2 and 3, there\u2019s a clear consistent pattern with a pivot column that distinguishes values. \n\nBy using this pivot column, I can establish a mapping rule according to the unique occurrences. This leads to a structured output for those rows, which simplifies the process significantly. The first example was puzzling, but it's helpful to focus on the others.",
