    "reasoning": "**Analyzing blocks in grid**\n\nI'm counting the rows and columns in the given input. There are 8 rows of 9 columns, while the previous training had a different structure with 10 rows of 7 columns. Now, I need to identify 2x2 blocks of 8. \n\nFor the first block (rows 1-2, cols 1-2), the calculations yield that the surrounding digits should be set up accordingly. The second block (rows 5-6, cols 3-4) has its own set of numbers around it as well. It's crucial to accurately place these digits based on the provided structure!**Updating output grid**\n\nI\u2019m starting with a grid that\u2019s mostly zeros, except for two 2x2 blocks of 8s. I\u2019ll create a copy of the input grid and update it following specific positions.\n\nFor the first block, I\u2019m placing 1, 2, 3, and 4 in their corresponding spots, while the second block gets its own placements. It\u2019s crucial I pay attention to what\u2019s being updated, especially row indices. After laying everything out, I\u2019ll end up with 8 rows of 9 columns, totaling up to the final output with all the modifications made. I need to check that everything aligns with the training examples too!**Noting block patterns**\n\nI\u2019ve realized they didn\u2019t increment the surrounding numbers in the two blocks; both have the same pattern of 1, 2, 3, and 4. This consistency is a good observation because it implies a structured approach across the blocks. I think it's important to recognize that maintaining the same numbering in both blocks can simplify the understanding of how they relate to each other, reinforcing the pattern rather than complicating it.",
