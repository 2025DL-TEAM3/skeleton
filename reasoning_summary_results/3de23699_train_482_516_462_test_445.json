For instance, Row 3 is 5005555, leading to digits 5, 0, 0, 5, 5 in positions. In Row 4, with 5500055, the zeros create a plus shape, marking their locations: (1,2), (1,3), and so forth. It seems that zeros symmetrically surround the center of the matrix, forming an interesting pattern. I'll summarize and clarify this matrix structure to visualize these coordinates better.**Examining zero and seven patterns**\n\nI'm finding a total of eight zeros distributed across the rows: three in Row 1, two in Row 2, and three in Row 3. These zeros seem to create a hollow cube-like pattern, surrounded by mostly 5s and some 7s at symmetrical positions. The output lines hint at a structure with the numbers 5 and 7, displaying a symmetrical formation. I\u2019m noting the positions of the 7s and considering their arrangement in relation to the background color, aiming to clarify my findings with precise details.**Identifying shape and holes in grid**\n\nI'm examining a grid that seems to represent an '8' shape, where the 5s likely fill in the holes of the 8. In the example grid, the outer border of the 8 is marked by 8s, while 1s serve as the background. It looks like the inner structures are made up of 5s forming two holes. I've pinpointed the coordinates of the 5s, which suggest the presence of two overlapping shapes. My goal is to clarify and extract the inner pattern formed by these numbers.**Determining color structure in grid**\n\nI'm working to analyze a grid and identify the regions filled with specific colors. It seems that the least frequent color represents the border, while the second most frequent color indicates the fill. After counting the frequencies, I find that 7s are the least frequent, making them the border, and 2s are the next, representing the fill. I can then extract a bounding box around the filled areas and transform the grid to reflect these color mappings. The final output grid retains symmetry, which looks promising!",
