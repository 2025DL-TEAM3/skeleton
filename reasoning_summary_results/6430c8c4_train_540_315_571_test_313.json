    "reasoning": "**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m exploring how each input row results in a 4-digit output. It seems like I'm trying to identify differences among similar rows. For instance, most rows are like \"004095555,\" but variations like \"000095055\" yield different outputs. The output seems to indicate the positions of differences from a template. With 9 columns possibly divided into sections, I\u2019m unsure if I\u2019m counting specific occurrences or differences. I think this might relate to previous tasks about counting colored items, but I need to clarify further.**Examining dimensional transformations**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how outputs transform based on different input grids. For example, in the first case, I have a 5x5 input grid resulting in a 5x2 output grid. It looks like I\u2019m reducing width while preserving some structure. In another example, the 7x3 input grid becomes a 3x3 output. Here, unique rows and columns are trimmed away, focusing on variations against uniform backgrounds. It seems that I\u2019m capturing specific shapes relative to reference rows, which help create a clearer representation.**Integrating output shapes**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand how to integrate different blocks in the output. It seems each output consists of just three rows, and I need to identify how they relate to the blocks above and below a separator. For example, in a 7x3 input, there's a division where the top shows anomalies. These are represented with certain digits in the output, specifically using \"3\" as the background filler and \"7\" for anomalies. I think I might need to count distinct anomalies and consider how their positions inform the output while exploring their respective shapes.",
