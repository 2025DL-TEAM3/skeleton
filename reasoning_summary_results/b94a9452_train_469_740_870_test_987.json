    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC Puzzle Patterns**\n\nI'm looking at this ARC puzzle, where the input and output seem to showcase some cropping going on with inner rectangles. In the examples provided, the outputs are reduced versions of the inputs, primarily focusing on central sections. For instance, the first example goes from a 5-row by 7-column grid to a 3-row by 6-column grid. It seems I need to identify the distinct patterns and sizes in these transformations to respond effectively. Let's dig deeper into understanding how the outputs relate to their inputs!**Examining Input Grid Structure**\n\nLet\u2019s break down Example 1 of the input grid array. It consists of several rows with different values: the outer boundary is formed by 8\u2019s, while the inner region is bordered by 9\u2019s, creating a frame. I see that the output represents a transformation, cropping the inner rectangle filled with 5\u2019s. Specifically, first and last rows are surrounded by the 9\u2019s, leading to a smaller area of 5's being highlighted. The structure reveals a distinct L-shape formed by the 8\u2019s along the borders.**Understanding Example 3's Grid Transformation**\n\nIn Example 3, I have a grid defined by borders of 9 that create an L-shape. The region inside, from rows 1 to 3 and columns 2 to 8, is primarily filled with 0's, except for a single 3 at row 2, column 7. The output grid turns this inner region into a new structure of 3's and reflects the changes from the original grid: 9's become 0's while maintaining the special 3 anomaly. I need to clarify if the transformation follows a consistent pattern before finalizing the transformation rules.",
