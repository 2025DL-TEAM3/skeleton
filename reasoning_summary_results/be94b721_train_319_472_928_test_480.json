This makes me think that output corresponds to a minimal bounding box with border cells being the closest non-3 values. It\u2019s a bit tricky! My alternate thoughts include looking at the training examples, where the main target color is the largest region, and I need to arrange the smaller surrounding shapes based on their colors and positions.**Examining input shapes and regions**\n\nIn example 2, the input is a 9x9 grid where the main color is 1, with other traps appearing as various numbers, like 5, 3, 9, 8, and 6 at specific coordinates. The output shows a shape of 3, which helps me see that this shape emerges from the connected sections in the grid. My understanding grows when counting the rows; it indeed is a 10x9 configuration, confirming that the 3s shape resides in rows 1-2 and columns 7-9, and that's reflected in the output. \n\nIn example 3, I need to assess a 7-row by 9-column grid. Colors include a background of 2, while 6 appears as a significant shape in the top left. The goal here is to assess the shapes of numbers 6, 9, and 3 while keeping the background noted.",
