For instance, I found coordinates for 4s in multiple rows, leading me to notice some formations resembling X shapes but not entirely symmetric. \n\nI recognize there are two distinct diagonal lines, offset by certain columns. This leads me to rethink the overall shape, which might actually resemble a diamond based on all the positions. It\u2019s interesting how these formations interact, and I'm curious about their implications!**Examining diamond shapes and counts**\n\nI'm analyzing the diamond shape formed by the 4s, noticing that it has a max width of 9 at row 4. However, the widths in rows 1 and 7 appear slightly off. I\u2019ve counted the occurrences of 4s across the rows and found some symmetry, yet it's not exact. \n\nFor instance, the zero counts also vary, leading me to rethink the concept of a minimal bounding rectangle containing all non-background cells. I\u2019ll need to refine my approach to collapsing the shape while removing rows or columns without 4s.",
