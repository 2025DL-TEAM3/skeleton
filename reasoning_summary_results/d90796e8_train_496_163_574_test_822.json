    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit swaps and patterns**\n\nI'm working through some digit swaps, where a 2 and a 6 in the number 2626626 change places to become 2666226. This suggests a dynamic mapping between those numbers. Counting the occurrences, I find that 2 appears 3 times and 6 appears 4 times in both versions. Similarly, in another example, the counts change after sorting. I notice this creates non-homogeneous regions, particularly focusing on where there's a mix like in the top-left corner of a grid.**Examining number clusters and patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing how clusters in a grid change while maintaining their shape. In the first example, a horizontal cluster of 2s and 3s is transformed into 2, 1, and 8. It\u2019s interesting to think about how these mappings occur\u2014could it involve subtracting neighbors or looking at differences between numbers? In the second example, I\u2019m identifying clusters of 1s, 2s, and 3s. The third example has 3s forming a diagonal shape, which transforms to 8s in the output, while 2s become 1s, revealing a complex pattern.**Exploring patterns in number grids**\n\nIn the first example, I'm wondering if there's a shape involving the number 3, but it seems there are only two separate positions. Instead, I think mapping 2s and 3s into new numbers might relate to their positions. I notice that in the provided rows, the replacement seems to maintain clusters or sequences. Examining frequency counts shows that certain numbers appearing exactly twice are mapped differently. In the second example, the rows changed consistently, but the logic behind these changes looks complex, potentially based on specific patterns across the grid.",
