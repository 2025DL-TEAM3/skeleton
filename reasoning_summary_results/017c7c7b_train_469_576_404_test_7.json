    "reasoning": "**Analyzing row mapping**\n\nI'm looking at how input rows transform into output rows, where seemingly each original row spawns additional ones. For instance, six input rows map to nine output rows, suggesting a 1.5 ratio. It seems they insert an additional row after every two input rows. I\u2019ll examine how these mappings work, particularly considering the values in the original rows and how they correspond to the new structure. There\u2019s a lot to unravel here about these transformations!**Understanding row transformation**\n\nIt looks like there\u2019s no original row seven, which means it's newly created. Since row seven equals 200 like rows one, three, and five, the pattern might continue beyond just the input rows. This suggests that the transformation adds 50% more rows vertically by repeating the existing row patterns until reaching 1.5 times the original count. Each non-zero digit gets recolored to '2,' while zeros remain unchanged. I\u2019ll confirm these findings with the test input to ensure everything aligns!**Finalizing output grid**\n\nThe output grid has been generated according to the established transformation rules. Here\u2019s how it looks:\n\n```\n0000\n0200\n0000\n0200\n0000\n0200\n0000\n0200\n0000\n```\n\nI\u2019ve ensured that this matches the expected pattern and maintains consistency with example observations. It appears correct based on the transformation process. There\u2019s no need for extra commentary at this point; the grid stands as the final result.",
