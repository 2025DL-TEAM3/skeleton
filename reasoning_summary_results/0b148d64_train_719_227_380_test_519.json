The input and output dimensions vary across examples. In Example 1, I'm looking closely at the input of 9x7 and how that leads to specific outputs like 2x4 in shape. I want to delve deeper into the first example and re-evaluate the rows for consistency, particularly focusing on any uniformities in the rows.**Identifying output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m revisiting the input data. Rows 1, 3, 6, 8, and 9 contain variations, but specifically, rows 8 and 9 show identical patterns. The output comprises two rows of \"3333,\" which seem to be drawn from those last two rows. It looks like the process extracts a 2x4 block of threes since they are the only color appearing exactly twice in those rows. Now, onto Example 2: I\u2019ll focus on patterns with colors 2 and 8 across the rows. I need to identify distinctive regions here too.**Examining block extraction**\n\nFor Example 2, the output consists of seven rows, each six digits long. It looks like they extracted a specific 6x6 block from the first seven rows of the input. I noticed the output corresponds to columns 0-5 from those rows. Rows beyond the sixth aren't printed, likely due to uniformity in colors. I'll need to explore Example 3 to see if they follow a similar extraction method. It seems the goal is indeed to find significant contiguous regions, possibly forming rectangles of specific colors.",
