I\u2019m identifying their coordinates and listing them out by row, like: Row3, col5; Row4, cols 5 and 6; Row5, col5, and so on. As I interpret the shapes, it seems this output might have a cross-like shape when plotted. I notice some symmetry but it contrasts with the input shape, suggesting my output might be a rotated version. I need to consider how they overlay on a grid.**Listing rotated shapes**\n\nI\u2019m listing the coordinates of these rotated shapes, putting together relative points. It seems there\u2019s a discrepancy in the counts; I actually have 10 occurrences of 2\u2019s in the output, while the input only had 9 nines, suggesting growth in shape. This doesn't seem like a simple rotation. I think the output might be a morphological dilation or a union of the original shape and its rotation. Exploring unions and reflections might reveal more, especially looking at similar examples.**Setting up output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing the test input, trying to identify the background and shape, where the majority color is 4 and the shape is formed by 0's. I\u2019ll create a grid where the background is filled with 4\u2019s, except for the cells that are 0's, which I'll shift down and replace with 2\u2019s. As I list their positions, I see there are certain zeros in rows 5 through 7. After I shift these shapes down, I\u2019m looking to finalize the output based on the modified positions while ensuring the correct background remains intact.**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI\u2019m examining the rows in the grid. Rows 1 to 4 are all 4\u2019s, and there\u2019s a horizontal bar of 0's on row 5. This shape does appear to shift down to rows 6, 7, and 8. Checking the expected output, I confirm the final values for each row and ensure correct lengths, following the pattern. It seems consistent that the shape is moved down a row. So, I finalize the output and confirm the rows and columns are all accurate.",
