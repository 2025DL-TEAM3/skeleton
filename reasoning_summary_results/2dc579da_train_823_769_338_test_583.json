    "reasoning": "**Understanding ARc Pattern Recognition**\n\nI'm processing some examples of ARc pattern recognition that seems to involve input-output pairs of digit grids. In the first example, a specific grid gives a single digit output, which is interesting! The second example also follows this logic but with a different output; it looks like the output can be printed multiple times based on the grid structure. I\u2019m noticing that the output may correspond to a count or a specific identification within those digit grids. It's all pretty fascinating!**Analyzing digit groups**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down how the counts of different digits in rows correspond to unique outputs. So, I started with counting fives and fours in a specific row. I initially reached a count of 8 for fives and 10 for fours, but I got confused about what \"unique\" means. It seems like it refers to the lowest total count across the grid. \n\nIn earlier examples, the unique digit is the one that appears the least often. I\u2019ve noticed some patterns, especially with repeated rows, which suggest that the output might be based on the common shapes formed by these rows rather than absolute uniqueness. It\u2019s pretty complex!**Decoding output shapes**\n\nIt seems like I\u2019m trying to figure out how the outputs relate to unique row patterns and overall digit frequencies. It looks like the goal might be to identify the least frequent digit, but in the examples, the outputs don\u2019t always align perfectly with that logic.\n\nExamining the shapes in the grid reveals areas where digits cluster. I\u2019m considering how rectangles or other shapes extracted from the grid might be represented in the output. Some shapes seem to be printed as repeated patterns, highlighting the common structure found within. It\u2019s all a bit complex, but I\u2019m working through the details!**Evaluating color components**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the characteristics of components for different colors in a provided grid. For example, I noticed that color 9 has a rectangular component, while color 2 comprises multiple non-rectangular components. In another example, I found that color 3 forms an irregular T-shape, which disqualifies it, considering only rectangular components are valid.\n\nUltimately, I determined that only color 8's component is rectangular and singular, leading to the output of \"88.\" I\u2019ll double-check to ensure that nothing else qualifies, confirming that \"88\" is indeed the final answer.",
    "test_output_text": "88\n",
    "correct": true
