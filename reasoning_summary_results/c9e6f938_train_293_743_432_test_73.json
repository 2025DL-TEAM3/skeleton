Observing how 772 becomes 772277 makes sense as well. When considering 5437, its reverse is 7345, so the combined output should be 54377345. Further examples, like 9623 turning into 96233269 and 3830 into 38300383, show a clear pattern: the output is simply the input followed by its reverse.**Establishing output rules**\n\nI realized that I need to preserve leading zeros when reversing the digits. My new rule is to concatenate the input string with its reversed version. Testing this with two-digit inputs, I found that 33 becomes 3333, 93 turns into 9339, and so on. For example, 39 combines with its reverse, resulting in 3993. After calculating all these, I ended up with the output grid, ensuring each result is on its own line. The final outputs are: 3333, 9339, 8338, 7997, 3993, 7337, 3773.",
