    "reasoning": "**Considering rectangle movement**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out that the distance from the rectangle to the outer border is 2, with a gap at col7 and a marker at col8 that overwrites the border. It seems like I need to slide the rectangle right until it hits the marker. In another example, the marker was used to determine the location for movement, so maybe I should align the rectangle\u2019s center with the marker. I also wonder if the rectangle should reflect across the marker instead, but the placement complicates things. They only displayed one rectangle, so I\u2019ll have to clarify my approach further.**Analyzing rectangle movement**\n\nIt looks like I'm examining a movement scenario in the input grid where the rectangle sits between specific values. The marker is positioned at col9 in row0, making it the top right corner of the rectangle. Since the marker is to the right, it seems the rectangle should slide rightward. The new output indicates this movement has occurred: the rectangle expands to fill the gap up to the marker location. So, it's clear the rectangle moved right to accommodate the marker in its new position.**Understanding rectangle extension**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out that the rectangle has two sides; the left border stays at col3 while the right border moves to col8, turning the old right border into an interior color. The boundaries stay consistent, so I find the rectangle colors and the marker, which is 4 at row0 col4. This means I need to extend the rectangle upward to fill the gap between the marker and the rectangle top border. I\u2019ll apply this extension to the test input next!**Extending the rectangle upward**\n\nI need to extend the rectangle upward from the current top border at row3 to the marker at row0. The left and right borders at col2 and col6 will remain, and the bottom border stays at row6. This means the old top border becomes interior, and any rows in between (rows1 and 2) will also be interior. \n\nSo, I\u2019ll fill in the output grid accordingly, replacing the marker's value with the new border color. Each row will reflect these changes while ensuring the overall structure maintains consistency with the rectangle.",
