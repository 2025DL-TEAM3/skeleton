    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input transformation**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that position col7 corresponds to input col2, which calculates to six for the positions 6, 7, and 8. It looks like 7 appears in the center horizontally. Each non-zero input cell might create a vertical line or shape of length 3 horizontally. For example, if an input is at (r, c), it could form a plus shape centered at (r, c*3+1), affecting just that output position. But I\u2019m trying to clarify how inputs map correctly to outputs in this case.**Clarifying mapping and shapes**\n\nI'm trying to understand the mapping of inputs to outputs, particularly with input [1, 1] where there's no output for 3. It looks like the mapping varies, as I found some outputs that correspond to non-6 values \u2014 specifically, (row1, col7)=7, (row3, col4)=3, and (row3, col7)=7. \n\nHowever, I noticed some confusion around 9 mapping to an output position that seems off. To simplify things, I might consider using a consistent plus shape for each input position to guide the outputs, centering appropriately based on the input's row.**Exploring input-output mapping**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing two input blocks that are essentially 3x3 rings. The first block has a ring of 8s surrounding a hole, while the second block also appears to contain rings. I observed the positions of 8 in the second block and found two of them at (3,2) and (5,0). \n\nIt seems that for each non-8 entry in the input, an 8-ring is drawn in the output centered on the input value. This reflects a pattern where every input cell generates a 3x3 output block, creating a large output grid based on the original colors.**Constructing output rows**\n\nI'm working on forming row4 which should be 18 characters long. It consists of 13 zeros followed by '3', '0', '0', '7', and another '0'\u2014totaling 18 characters, which works out. \n\nSo, my output will include 9 rows, each with 18 columns. The first four and last four rows are all zeros, while row4 is \"000000000000030070.\" I hope I\u2019ve organized everything correctly. I\u2019m still a bit unsure, but I\u2019ll present the result as planned.",
