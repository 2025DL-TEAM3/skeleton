    "reasoning": "**Examining movements and anomalies**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that the original '1' at (3,0) has turned into a '2', while a new '1' appeared at (2,1). It seems the '1' moved one space up and one right, possibly heading towards the '4' that was at (1,2). The final position of '1' is at (2,1), maybe indicating a symmetry around the line between these numbers. Perhaps there\u2019s a swapping of coordinates happening around the '4'. \n\nLooking at Example 2, I can see that the anomalies are the '3' at (1,5) and the '4' at (7,5) in an 8x7 grid.**Analyzing anomaly movements**\n\nI see that the input '0' was initially at (7,5) and moved to (6,4), heading one step toward the '4' located at (4,2). So it looks like there\u2019s a rule where two colored anomalies exist on a uniform background. Both anomalies appear once, and the source anomaly moves closer to the target. \n\nIn all examples, the anomaly not being '4' moves one step toward it, which allows diagonal movement too. For the current input, the anomalies are '4' at (6,2) and '6' at (8,4), meaning '6' will move to (7,3).**Updating the grid layout**\n\nI see that the '4' is at (6,2), and the '6' moves one step diagonally to (7,3) from (8,4). This matches the pattern where the source anomaly shifts toward the target anomaly. The old '6' disappears and is replaced by '0'. \n\nSo, the new grid layout will keep the '4' in its original position while placing the '6' at the newly calculated location. Row 7 changes from all zeros to '000600', and Row 8 transforms to all zeros. The final output grid looks like this:\n\n```\n000000\n000000\n000000\n000000\n000000\n000000\n004000\n000600\n000000\n```",
