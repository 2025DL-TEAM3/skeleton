    "reasoning": "**Analyzing anomalies in data**\n\nI\u2019m mapping anomalies in the input. I see that row 3 has an anomaly with a zero at column 2. In the output, I find that row 1, column 3 has a 5, while row 2 doesn\u2019t have any 5s. Oddly, row 3 does have a 5 at column 5. So, it looks like the anomalies influence the positions of the 5 in different rows. It seems like there\u2019s a diagonal pattern or line being formed here with the coordinates (1,3) and (3,5). Interesting!**Exploring data patterns**\n\nI\u2019m noticing a diagonal line from northwest to southeast formed by points (1,3) and (3,5) \u2014 the slope is 1, but there\u2019s something odd: the center cell (Row 2, Column 4) has a 0 instead of a 5, indicating they didn\u2019t fill in the line completely. In Task 2, I see the anomaly at row 10, column 2, resulting in a change only for row 1, where they swapped column 3 from 6 to 5. It seems like vertical mapping is at play across tasks, but the inconsistencies between the rows are puzzling.**Understanding the diagonal line and patterns**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out the diagonal line with a slope of +1 that should extend from the anomaly. It seems like they might have marked only the endpoints instead of filling the whole line. I realize I\u2019m getting confused with the direction of the slope and how to calculate the corresponding points. The line formed by those 5s doesn\u2019t pass through the anomaly, suggesting it\u2019s indeed parallel. Also, it looks like there\u2019s a consistent rule for marking zeros in even columns, which might relate to the presence of color 0 in the input. I\u2019m really wrestling with these patterns!",
