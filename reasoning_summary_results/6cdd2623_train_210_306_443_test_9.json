    "reasoning": "**Analyzing row patterns**\n\nI'm looking at the second row: 44444446, and trying to figure out why the last digit changes from 6 to 4. This ends up giving me the output 44544454. Ah, it seems like there\u2019s a consistent introduction of the number 5 at specific columns, particularly in positions 2 and 6. As I analyze the outputs from the set, I notice there are regular patterns. Rows with mostly 4s and 5s yield a fixed grid, while others lead to more varied outputs.**Exploring rows and patterns**\n\nI see that for these two rows, the input has four distinct numbers surrounding the 4s, but I need to generalize to find which rows match the B pattern. In training1, the B pattern (55555555) shows up in two consecutive rows, specifically rows 4 and 5. These rows contain distinct clusters of non-4 and non-5 digits. It seems like they fit into a specific cross-shaped pattern in the input, which might be driven by some underlying rule regarding majority colors and detecting symmetrical patterns.**Identifying patterns in rows**\n\nI'm analyzing B rows, which fill an entire row with a specific marker color. In the third puzzle, they place default markers at columns 5 and 6, right of the center but not symmetrical. It\u2019s essential to identify the larger shape in this training: the right cluster spans columns 5 to 8. Default pattern A seems to match the first row, influencing other rows unless specific criteria are met. Special pattern B replaces rows with a uniform marker color, like 4 in training 2 or 5 in training 1.**Determining marker values and patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing clusters in training3, which have left (maybe 8) and right (9) clusters. Here, 9 is the dominant value to pick, based on frequency counts. Upon reviewing, it seems 8 is more scattered, while 7 forms a symmetrical rectangle shape, suggesting it could be the marker. For default positions, I notice row0 holds value 7 in columns 2 and 3. B rows are those where the first and last columns have the marker, and the only one meeting this criterion is row 6, so its output is all 7s. The final grid reflects this.",
