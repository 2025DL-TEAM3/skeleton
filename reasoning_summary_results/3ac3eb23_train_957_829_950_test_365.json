    "reasoning": "**Analyzing anomaly characteristics**\n\nI'm considering whether row 3 in example 3 is also an anomaly as originally noted. It seems like there may be more anomalies not being printed, but I'm leaning towards that not being the case. Looking closer at row 4, it shows 599999999, and row 3 shows 999999999, suggesting that the anomaly is solely at row 4. In fact, the real anomaly here is marked by a single '5', as row 3 has 9's surrounding it. So, it looks like the output should visually represent this single cell anomaly effectively.**Examining output pattern rules**\n\nCenter cell with dist=0 means it shows '5', indicating an anomaly color. As I check surrounding cells, those at dist=1 should show '9', and they do. Then, dist=2 gets '5', while dist=3 goes back to '9'. It seems that the pattern follows a rule based on distance from the center and a defined threshold \u2014 cells seem to fill a range but probably not the entire grid. \n\nIt appears they apply a specific checkerboard filling method around the center, focusing on certain rows rather than changing everything uniformly.**Investigating anomaly patterns**\n\nIn example 3, I'm trying to understand the parity pattern for the full grid: if the distance is even, it shows '5\u2019, otherwise \u20189\u2019. However, it seems row 1 isn't following this pattern since it remains all '9's. It makes me think there\u2019s a specific distance threshold in play, likely to preserve certain rows. \n\nAlso, I see that the anomaly only affects some cells, suggesting a checkerboard pattern based on distance, but it gets complicated with how they handle rows differently. I'll keep exploring this!**Exploring output patterns**\n\nIn example 1, it looks like the anomaly row at the bottom leads to an alternating pattern. I see that rows switch between patterns A and B, starting with A at row 1. This gives a clear output structure that I expect to see, but example 3 doesn't match this established pattern. \n\nIt seems that the pattern alternation might only apply to specific rows based on the anomaly location, with distance from borders also affecting the propagation. Given these findings, I think the best approach for the output is indeed to apply the alternating patterns for the rows based on example 1.",
