    "reasoning": "**Exploring puzzle rules**\n\nI\u2019m trying to find a consistent rule for the puzzle. One alternative approach I\u2019m considering is placing numbers diagonally to link the colored blocks in sequence by labels. My hypothesis is that I can trace a path connecting the centers of colored squares in a 2x2 grid, marking continuous diagonals. For example, connecting two blocks of value 1 before moving on to others. I need to ensure the path follows the defined rows carefully.**Mapping connections**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to connect the second value 1 block to the value 2 block. The path should go from the first block, which is at positions (2,3) to the second block at (6,2). I could create a diagonal path or maybe use two segments. The first segment might connect upward to an empty space, with marks indicating the path of (1,2) and (0,1). It seems they didn't mark the direct connection from the first block to the second, opting instead for separate marking rows.**Confirming drawing rules**\n\nI\u2019m outlining the rule for drawing connections in a 2x2 block of repeated digits. For an odd value, I draw a diagonal northwest ray from the top-left cell, and for an even value, I draw a southeast ray from the bottom-right cell. I\u2019ll check the input grid for occurrences. For example, in the 6x6 grid, I find an even value (2) and only draw southeast rays from the identified block. I'll ensure the grid remains intact while marking the rays accurately in the final output.",
