It seems consistent\u2014top bar gets 2s, middle bar has 4s, and the bottom bar gets 1s. But in another example, row 1 goes to 2, middle rows to 1, and row 6 to 4 which seems off. I think I need to focus on sequences and how they match up in their positions. Let's clarify this with the examples!**Analyzing color sequences and bar shapes**\n\nI'm figuring out the assigned new colors for bars: the top bar gets 2, the next bar gets 4, and the bottom bar 1. In the second example, there are 3 bars, but row 1 has zeros in columns 1-2, potentially indicating an incomplete section. The central bar features 9s from rows 2-5 in column 4, while the bottom bar spans columns 5-7 in row 6.\n\nThese shapes suggest one horizontal line at the top, a vertical line in the center, and another horizontal line at the bottom. It seems the second bar's vertical alignment affects the color assignment. I\u2019ll confirm the sequences between the examples to ensure everything matches.**Understanding object color mapping**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the mapping of output colors for objects with sizes {1, 2, 4}. We\u2019re assigning colors based on their counts matching the original object sizes. The first step is identifying the background color and any other object colors. After counting the sizes of these objects, we\u2019ll match them to the new color set, which includes 1, 2, and 4. \n\nThis approach will ensure that color assignments correspond to object sizes while maintaining a consistent order. The process appears to yield various valid mappings, but they should respect the initial sequence of the objects.",
