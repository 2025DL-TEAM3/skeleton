    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid expansion**\n\nI'm looking at the task of transforming a smaller grid into a larger one. The input is a 4x5 grid, and from my observations, the output expands into an 8x10 format! \n\nThe expansion seems to involve symmetrical tiling of the input grid. Specifically, the top-left quadrant mirrors the original, while the other quadrants reflect either horizontally or vertically. It\u2019s interesting to see how the bottom-left corresponds to a vertical mirror of the top-left. This symmetry creates a cohesive larger grid from the smaller input.**Reflecting on grid transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing how to create an output grid by reflecting a smaller input grid both horizontally and vertically. \n\nThe top-left quadrant remains unchanged, while the top-right reflects horizontally. The bottom-left reflects vertically, reversing the order of rows. For the bottom-right, I need to reflect both, which requires reversing the rows after applying the horizontal reflection. \n\nUltimately, I've constructed an output grid that follows the correct pattern. The rows are \"1661\", \"4224\", \"4224\", and \"1661\". This matches the expected output, confirming I\u2019ve got it right!",
