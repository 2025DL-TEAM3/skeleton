    "reasoning": "**Exploring convolution patterns**\n\nI'm thinking about how convolution might relate to neighbor differences, possibly yielding combinations from input grids. It seems that while it could be summing neighbor values, multiplication by a kernel feels more intuitive. In my first example, mapping a value of 99 to 89 hints at the influence of a neighbor value of 4 in the input. I need to map this carefully by looking at the full grid and noting where values of 4 impact the output. Each output cell likely corresponds to the combination of neighboring input cells.**Revising block expansions**\n\nI'm considering how to modify the border blocks when two adjacent input blocks differ, and how to reflect that in the output. Each input cell should expand into a 2x2 block, but at the boundaries where the values change, the pattern shifts. \n\nIn my example, the input at (3,2) is 4, and if I check the corresponding output, I find that rows 5 and 6 are actually filled with 9s. So, instead of simply expanding the value, maybe I should represent transformations in the output blocks. I also wonder if I'm actually calculating distances from the nearest significant value.**Analyzing anomaly patterns**\n\nI'm examining how anomalies are located between different coordinate systems. In the top-left (TL) pattern, I see an anomaly at (4,2), which corresponds to a similar location in the bottom-left (BL) system. But here's the twist: while the anomalies maintain their relative positions, their values differ between the two coordinates. \n\nIt looks like most rows match, except for row 1, where the values vary between the systems. I'm considering whether different input anomalies are affecting these outputs, and it seems like the quadrants might interact differently with the anomalies. I need to simplify my analysis. Each input cell seems to map to a 2x2 patch in the output grid, reflecting its value or default.**Exploring anomaly propagation**\n\nI'm analyzing how to manage anomalies in the TL grid. For each anomaly, I identify diagonal neighbors and set those positions to 8 unless another anomaly is present. When applying this method, I noticed changes in values in specific rows due to anomalies at certain positions. The propagation of these values revealed patterns, but also some inconsistencies.\n\nI suspect that, rather than just one-step diagonal changes, multiple levels of propagation occur, filling in values symmetrically. To compute TL correctly, I need to carefully track these connections and how they influence surrounding values.",
