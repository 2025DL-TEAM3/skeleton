The first example shows that the input of '1717' changes to '1217', which suggests that specific digits, like the second '7', transform to a '2'. The other lines remain unchanged. The second example highlights a similar pattern\u2014wherein the line '4474744' becomes '4472744', indicating a specific mapping on the second digit as well. It\u2019s interesting to see these transformations!**Examining transformation changes**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the input '4474744' which transforms to '4472744', showing how the fourth character changes from '4' to '2'. In the third example, I see '878788888' changing to '872788888', with the third column changing from '8' to '2'. The transformations reflect specific patterns in the rows. It seems that the process involves identifying these symmetrical or alternating patterns, particularly focusing on the digit '7' as the key to the transformation. I'm curious about how these rules apply throughout!**Processing output transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing the transformation for rows based on the provided patterns. In row 1, I see how the neighbors affect the output, leading to a change from '1' to '2', which results in '11727111'. Looking at row 2, it similarly transforms to '72711111' due to the same logic. Row 3 follows a similar pattern. Row 4 is identical to row 3, thus having the same output. Row 5 remains unchanged. Finally, row 6 transforms to '17271111'. The final outputs match the expected format.",
