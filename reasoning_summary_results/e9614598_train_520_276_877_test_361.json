The first example has a uniform grid with \u20180\u2019 as the background and two \u20189\u2019s at specific positions. The output reveals a pattern, likely drawing the shortest path between anchor points. I\u2019m noting the consistent background digit while observing how different colors (digits) are used strategically in the output to create these connections. This seems to follow a systematic approach to connecting these key points visually.**Decoding diamond shapes in output**\n\nLooking at sample two, I\u2019m analyzing the input of five rows and seven columns filled with \u20187\u2019s and two \u20189\u2019s positioned at row 0, columns 2 and 6. The output shows a diamond shape with \u20183\u2019s filling in the spaces. This creates a pattern with the middle point at (0,4) and extends downward to (1,4). It seems like they\u2019ve formed a half-diamond connecting the two \u20189\u2019s, similar to the output from the first sample where a full diamond was drawn.**Filling diamond shapes in the grid**\n\nI'm analyzing how to fill in the diamond shapes based on the grid input. In sample three, I see two \u20184\u2019s located at (3,1) and (3,7) on the same row, which will act as endpoints. The midpoint is calculated as (3,4), allowing me to place \u20183\u2019s centered around that position without overwriting the \u20184\u2019s. For the output, I ensure that I maintain the original values while modifying the necessary cells. The processed grid looks consistent with the original patterns.",
