    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI'm exploring the grid pattern here. The next layer seems to involve 6s at specific rows and columns. Inside that layer, I note a 4x2 area filled with 1s, except for some 9s. This suggests the 9s are positioned within a designated area. I\u2019m questioning if the rule involves rotating the grid. When testing a rotation, I notice discrepancies in outputs. I doubt it\u2019s a simple rotate or reflect, so I need to dig deeper into training data for clarity.**Examining grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing entries in a 7x10 grid. The input features two 4x4 blocks with some patterns of 5s and 4s, and I\u2019m trying to clarify their arrangement. It seems there's some randomness with zeros that isn't immediately relevant, but, I'm seeing how the two squares are structured in the center. \n\nThen, I move to another input grid where I'm noticing a ring of 2s surrounding a pattern of zeros. Understanding these behaviors might clarify how certain rules apply across different patterns, leading to a more consistent output.**Understanding zero patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the placement of zeros in a grid input. It seems like there's a central shape made of zeros, which gets shifted during the output. I\u2019ve identified their coordinates and noted how they form a vertical bar. \n\nAs I examine the output, the zeros appear to have moved towards the outer ring of the grid. I realize that this transformation might follow a pattern where shapes in the grid shift along established frames. This leads me to understand how shapes can expand or change positions in a structured way through similar transformations.",
