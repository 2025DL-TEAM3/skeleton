    "reasoning": "**Figuring out removed column**\n\nI'm trying to determine which input column was removed by mapping. I\u2019ll map input indices from 0 to 9, attempting to delete column 8 first. When I remove it, input row 5 shows values 77777777, resulting in some calculations. If I delete column 7, there's still a 5 in column 8, which stays in output column 7, creating confusion since the output shouldn\u2019t have any 5s. I can\u2019t delete both columns; I must decide carefully.**Analyzing row outputs**\n\nLooking at row 6, it has a 0 followed by eight 7s, indicating a replacement of all 5s with 7s. In row 7, the input shows a mix of values, including a 6 that's replaced with a 7 in the output, but the 5s at positions 6 and 7 remain unchanged. This suggests they didn't globally replace all 5s. In row 6, though, the existing 5s were all changed to 7s. This inconsistency raises questions, especially if columns were removed. I'm thinking about deleting column 8 in this context.**Mapping input and output**\n\nI'm delving into how to assign pairs for rows 7 and 8 based on their values. I note the pairs in both input and output columns. For example, input column 0 (8,8) maps directly to output column 0. \n\nHowever, inconsistencies arise, like in how the values from different rows seem to map differently. It\u2019s confusing because the rules for mapping seem to vary per column. As I investigate further, I think maybe they're adapting the structure to represent a certain shape, where some columns might be eliminated to reduce width. \n\nThis approach leads me to consider simpler examples for clarity.",
