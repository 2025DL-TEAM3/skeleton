    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformation**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this ARC-like puzzle that transforms an input grid of digits into a larger output grid. The input grid has 8 rows and 5 columns, while the output has 10 rows and 7 columns. It seems the output dimensions are derived by adding 2 to each dimension of the input, which holds true across examples. So for an input of 3x6, the output becomes 5x8. This pattern is really interesting!**Clarifying row transformations**\n\nI\u2019m aligning output lines from the puzzle and analyzing how each row is constructed. For instance, Row 1 takes the first input digit, adds zeros, and replicates input digits. Row 2\u2019s pattern follows a similar structure, with left and right borders drawn from the relevant input. Each row respects a specific rule: the left and right borders correspond to the first and last digits of the input rows, while keeping the necessary structure intact. It\u2019s intriguing how these transformations work!**Verifying grid padding rules**\n\nI\u2019m checking how the padding applies to the grid transformation. For the output grid, each row gets a top and bottom border of zeros, with the side borders drawing from the first and last elements of the input rows. I've noticed that the process holds across different examples, consistently following the rule of padding and copying relevant elements.\n\nTaking my latest input example, I'll ensure to construct the 5x9 grid carefully, confirming the final output format meets expectations. Everything's looking good so far!",
