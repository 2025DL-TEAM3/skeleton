    "reasoning": "**Analyzing data anomalies**\n\nIt seems that the data processing isn't retaining singletons; instead, it's inconsistent with anomalies. For example, there are two occurrences of the number 8, and it looks like they kept the lower at (3,5). Why did they keep 4 from row 2 while removing 5? This confusion continues when looking at row 3, where both 4s were present, but only the leftmost was kept. It's puzzling how decisions on retaining values are made.**Exploring anomaly clustering**\n\nIn row 2, they kept the 4 at col 3, but removed other 4s and 9s in other rows. I'm wondering if they only retain anomalies from the largest connected clusters. When assessing connectivity in my examples, it seems that adjacent values stay, while isolated values get removed. For the 8s, they kept one even when both are non-adjacent. \n\nThis raises the question: do they prioritize clusters closer to the grid's bottom? It feels like I\u2019m uncovering patterns related to cluster size and position, but I'm still trying to piece it all together.**Analyzing anomaly retention**\n\nIn example 2, row 1 had one anomaly but it got removed, leaving it empty. Meanwhile, row 2 kept one anomaly at (2,6) and row 3 held on to (3,5). My observation suggests they might keep only one anomaly per row. In example 1, row 3 initially had two anomalies, but they only retained (3,3). \n\nIt seems they're favoring clusters of adjacent anomalies. I wonder if they look for primary lines or segments among these anomalies, sometimes selecting based on highest columns or non-horizontal alignments. This is getting complicated, especially with ties between lines!",
