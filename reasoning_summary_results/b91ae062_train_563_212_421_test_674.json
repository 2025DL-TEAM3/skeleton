For example, the input digits \"50\" and \"49\" create a grid where each digit expands into a 3x3 block. The output indeed results in a 6x6 grid. Each pixel in the original 2x2 input is replaced by a 3x3 block of the same number. This means for \"50,\" the first three rows consist of '5's followed by '0's, while the last three rows show '4's and '9's.**Investigating scale factors**\n\nI\u2019m looking into how the input scales to produce a larger grid. The rule seems to be that each input pixel is expanded into a 3x3 block for the first example, translating a 2x2 input to a 6x6 output. The second example scales a 5x2 input to 10x4, and the last converts a 3x4 input to 6x8. I\u2019m wondering if the expansion factor connects to the number of distinct digits in the input, suggesting the scale could be the count of unique digits minus one. That would explain the variations!",
