For the first example with 8 rows and 6 columns, it looks like the rows were sorted. The output shows that the first three rows are \"777777\" (all 7s) and the next five are \"727777\" (with a 2). I wonder if they sorted them in reverse lexicographical order, with larger values appearing first. So, \"727777\" is indeed less than \"777777.\"**Clarifying sorting in puzzles**\n\nI realize that \"777777\" is greater, so they're sorting in descending lexicographical order. In example two with 10 rows and 8 columns, the output suggests that rows are grouped differently. I count the input values: there should be three \"99999999,\" yet the output lists four. That indicates something unusual, as it doesn't match input multiplicities. I wonder if they are grouping by some pattern instead of just sorting rows. This appears more complex than I initially thought!**Investigating pattern propagation**\n\nI'm considering whether the puzzle rules involve changing some rows based on frequency. It might work like cellular automata. In the third example, with a 9x5 grid, the output shows a count of the most common elements. \n\nThe input had two \"11111\" rows and several \"11110\" rows, but in the output, there are two \"11111\" and six \"11110.\" It seems they lost one \"11010\" element and converted a \"01110\" into \"11110.\" That's a notable change in rows!**Examining output changes**\n\nThe output shows that row 9 is \"01010,\" which isn't just a simple swap of \"01110.\" The unique pattern \"11010\" from row 4 appears as row 9, indicating a change in how rows were organized. It seems they sorted the rows lexicographically in descending order. \n\nThe distinct patterns I identified include \"11111,\" \"11110,\" \"11010,\" and \"01110.\" However, the output doesn\u2019t retain the \"11010\" and \"01110\" rows, which suggests they changed something beyond sorting. It looks like \"01010\" results from flipping some columns. That\u2019s intriguing!**Analyzing column changes**\n\nI'm noticing a pattern change in the middle column. For instance, in input row 8 (01110), the output row 9 (01010) shows a flip in column 3, changing 1 to 0. This is the only difference here. Meanwhile, input row 4 (11010) becomes output row 8 (11110), where column 3 changes from 0 to 1. So, it seems they swapped the column 3 bits between these rows. It does suggest that they may have sorted or manipulated column 3 in some way!**Examining column 3 changes**\n\nLet\u2019s look specifically at column 3 across the rows. For the input, row 4 is the only one with a 0; all other rows have a 1 in this column. So, only one zero appears in column 3. In the output, when I check column 3, I notice that the zero from row 4 has shifted to row 9. It seems they moved the zero in this column to the bottom. I wonder if this pattern holds for other columns, especially in the first example where I want to check where the 2s are in column 2.**Analyzing column 2 changes**\n\nIn the input data, I notice that there are multiple 2s in column 2, specifically in five rows. The values are mostly a mix of 7s and 2s, with the following pattern: [7, 2, 2, 7, 7, 2, 2, 2]. If I sort column 2 in descending order, the expectation is to have all 7s at the top. \n\nAfter counting, I realize there are actually four rows with a 7 in column 2, not three. So, the sorted output for column 2 should show rows 1-3 as 7s, followed by rows 4-8 as 2s. I wonder if the other columns' values were maintained, especially since row 4 in the output appears to have taken its values from row 2 of the input.**Sorting rows by column 2**\n\nIt looks like the rows are moved based on sorting column 2 in descending order. In testing this, I see that columns with the highest values (7) come first, followed by the lower values (2). From the input, I note that rows 1, 4, and 5 have the value 7, and their outputs remain in the same stable order. \n\nThen, the next set of rows shows that rows 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 (which all have the value 2) appear next in the output. So everything seems to line up correctly. Now I wonder about the next example and which column will have variations to sort by.**Analyzing column sorting**\n\nI need to find a column that serves as the target for sorting. It looks like we initially sorted by column 1, and the values are [2, 9, 9, 9, 2, 9, 2, 9, 9, 2]. When sorting in descending order, all 9s come first, followed by the 2s. \n\nI see that the first six output rows should correspond to the input rows with col1=9, but there's a mismatch with the values. It seems I might not be capturing the stable sort correctly. So, I wonder if sorting by another column, like col4, could clarify the variations. Let's take a closer look at that.**Sorting analysis for column five**\n\nIt looks like there are six rows where col5 equals 1 in the output, which matches the input. They seem to have sorted the rows in descending order by col5 values, grouping all the 9s first, then the 1s. \n\nIn the group with col5=9, I see input rows three through six should have maintained their original order. Yet, the actual output shows four rows, all listed as 99999999. So, it appears that the 29999999 from row five somehow got excluded. That's quite puzzling, but I think I need to double-check the data to clarify what's happening.**Exploring sorting rules**\n\nIt looks like output row three was expected to be row five, but surprisingly, output is 99999999, while row five is 29999999. This suggests they didn't include row five. Perhaps they only grouped by rows with col5=9 and col1=9? It makes me wonder if the rule is to consider the maximum values in those columns. \n\nAlternatively, it might be simpler to sort based on the frequency of the highest counts in the rows. I\u2019m reflecting on how example one and two had their own frequency distributions, and it seems they sorted accordingly in both cases.**Analyzing frequency for sorting**\n\nIn example three, I need to find a column with two values and their frequencies for sorting. First, I evaluate the frequencies of values in each column. For col1, I see eight ones and one zero, while in col2, all values are one. Col3 matches col1. For col4, it appears all rows except row eight have a one. Col5 gives two ones and seven zeros. \n\nIt seems both col1 and col3 have a high frequency of ones. I wonder if the choice will be based on the column with the largest variation, but it might be tricky to determine.**Sorting and column selection**\n\nI\u2019m checking col1, where the values are 2:4 and 9:6, and col5 with counts of 1:6 and 9:4. Both have similar distributions, but I wonder which one is used for sorting. It seems sorting by col1 didn\u2019t work, while col5 did. Maybe the rule is to choose the column with the smallest numeric variation. \n\nIn example three, I\u2019ll sort by col5 descending. With this, I find the output rows are correct, matching the input order for rows with col5 equals 1 and 0.**Examining output rows**\n\nI see that the actual output includes row3 as 11110, which seems right. However, row4 is also 11110, and I\u2019m noticing that row5 through row9 all appear as 11110, except row9 is 01010. There\u2019s confusion here since row8 should show 01110 but was counted as row9 instead. It's possible they swapped columns or missed including row4 in the order. It seems like they might have sorted by one column and then applied secondary sorting for identical rows. I think I should test sorting example three first by col5 descending and then col3 descending.**Analyzing row sorting**\n\nI'm examining the input rows where col5=1, which include rows 2 and 9, both having col3=1. That's stable enough! Now, for the group with col5=0, I need to sort the rows by col3 descending. I've noted the col3 values for each row, so the order should begin with those having col3=1: rows 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8, followed by row 4 with col3=0. However, the actual output includes row8 as 11110 and row9 as 01010, suggesting a different sorting mechanism, possibly sorting independently within each column.**Exploring column-wise sorting**\n\nI'm looking at column-wise sorting for example 1. For each column, I'm checking frequencies. In col1, the values are consistent at 7, so no changes there. For col2, I'm sorting with descending values, which results in the vector [7,7,7,2,2,2,2,2]. The same goes for columns 3-6, which remain unchanged as they all have 7s. The output for this column-wise sort aligns with what I expected, including the correct values for all rows. Now, I'll move on to example 2 and apply the same sorting approach to its 10 rows.**Analyzing input matrix**\n\nI'm looking at the input matrix with ten rows and eight columns. \n\nFor col1, when sorting the values (2,9,9,9,2,9,2,9,9,2), I find six 9's and four 2's, so it becomes [9,9,9,9,9,9,2,2,2,2]. The subsequent columns, like col2, col3, and col4, remain unchanged since they all contain 9s. \n\nIn col5, the values (1,1,9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1) reorganize to [9,9,9,9,1,1,1,1,1,1] after sorting. The remaining columns (col6 to col8) also don't change.**Summarizing column-wise sort results**\n\nI've completed a column-wise sort on the matrix with 10 rows, and the results are shaping up well! \n\nRows 1 through 4 all contain 99999999 since they consist entirely of 9's. For rows 5 and 6, I see they both yield 99991999, which matches my expectations since col5 holds the 1 value. \n\nRows 7 through 10 all result in 29991999, which is consistent across them. So, the output is exact: rows 1-4 are 99999999; rows 5-6 are 99991999; and rows 7-10 are 29991999, confirming the sorting process.**Testing column-wise sort**\n\nLet's test a column-wise sort on a 9x5 matrix. \n\nFor col1, I have eight 1s and one 0, so after sorting, it becomes [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0]. \n\nCol2 remains all 1s, and for col3, it also has eight 1s and one 0, resulting in [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0].\n\nCol4 is unchanged with all 1s. Finally, for col5, sorting gives me two 1s followed by seven 0s, yielding [1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]. \n\nSo, the new matrix should look good, but I need to double-check row3, as it has a 0 in col5.",
