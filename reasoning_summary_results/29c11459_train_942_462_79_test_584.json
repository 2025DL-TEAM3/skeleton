    "reasoning": "**Clarifying seed propagation**\n\nI\u2019m considering how cells from column 1 to column 4 propagate. It seems that's more analogous to horizontal propagation across the row rather than vertical. With a row length of 7, seeds start at column 1 and column 7, moving towards each other and meeting at column 4. If their values differ, column 4 should end up with a value of 5. Looking at row 2: columns 1-3 show 7, column 4 is 5, and 5-7 are 1. The rules involve each seed propagating inward, filling columns until they meet.**Analyzing example 3**\n\nI'm analyzing example 3 which has dimensions of 9 rows and 5 columns. The input shows numbers across the rows, and my output transformations appear next to them. The background value seems to be 8, with certain rows having non-8 values at both ends. Specifically, rows 1, 3, and 6 populated as they don't match the background. I see how seeds propagate based on these conditions: when equal, it\u2019s a push to the center. However, row 2's center cell shows an output conflict, which raises questions on how I determine it.**Summarizing transformation rules**\n\nI'm exploring how to transform rows and columns based on seeds and background values. A line only transforms if both ends contain non-background colors, while the middle remains background. I found that example 1 and 3 applied transformations on rows, whereas example 2 focused on columns. \n\nFor a specific input grid, I determined that 6 is the background and found mixed patterns in rows 1 and 9. Consequently, I'll apply transformations vertically on columns with valid seeds at the extremes, ensuring the middle remains consistent.",
