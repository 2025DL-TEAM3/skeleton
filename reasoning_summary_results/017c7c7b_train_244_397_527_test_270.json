The input has 6 rows with a color alternating with blank rows, while the output has expanded to 9 rows. The output replaces each colored cell with a new value and adds three more color pairs, completing the pattern. It's interesting to note how the existing pattern of alternating colors is extended for balance, ending with an additional blank row to achieve a more symmetric structure. Let's keep working on this!**Examining row patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the row patterns across multiple inputs. The current input has three occurrences of colored rows, but the output increases that to four occurrences while adding blank rows at the top and bottom. \n\nIn the next example with six rows, I'm noticing a repeating structure involving two color types. The final output maintains this pattern while extending the cycle length, changing the color from 6 to 2, and eliminating blank rows altogether. It's all about identifying and adjusting those repeating cycles. Let's keep digging!**Mapping color patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the color patterns from test inputs compared to training data. It looks like every non-zero value is being mapped to 2, while zeros remain unchanged. The current input consists of six rows, and as I'm visualizing them, I see some distinct positions with 1s.\n\nI've identified repeating patterns, categorizing them into four unique types: A, B, C, and D. The output will consist of nine rows, following the same cycle pattern as training data while adjusting the colors accordingly. Everything checks out, so I\u2019ll present the final output grid!",
