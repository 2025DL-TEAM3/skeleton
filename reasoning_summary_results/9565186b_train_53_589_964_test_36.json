Going row by row, I can transform them as follows: \n\nRow 1: becomes \"44454,\"  \nRow 2: stays \"44444,\"  \nRow 3: becomes \"44445,\"  \nRow 4: turns into \"54444,\"  \nRow 5: remains \"44444,\"  \nRow 6: remains \"44444,\"  \nRow 7: turns into \"45454,\"  \nRow 8: becomes \"44455,\"  \nRow 9: changes to \"54444.\"  \n\nI make sure I have nine rows, so this is my final output!",
