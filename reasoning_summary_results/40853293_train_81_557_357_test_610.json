    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation rule**\n\nI'm looking at three examples that show how input pairs transform into outputs. The goal is to figure out the rule that connects them and apply it to new inputs. \n\nIn the first example, I notice 8's being formed within the zeros, while in the second, 1's emerge from the 6's. The third example has shapes being filled in a similar manner. It's interesting how these patterns evolve, and I'm keen to figure out the underlying logic!**Deciphering the input-output mapping**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a sequence where input shapes transform into output shapes. From the input \"080000800,\" I see two '8's at the ends. It seems the output fills the space between them with '8's, creating a horizontal line. \n\nChecking other rows, I note that a '4' in row 3 doesn't fill, while '5's in rows 4 and 9 suggest a vertical fill between them. The pattern reflective here suggests filling between identifiable numbers, and I need to further explore this with more examples!**Exploring overlapping pipelines**\n\nI'm analyzing output from input row 7, which shows how '3's interact. Both '3's are kept but one is replaced by '1'. This suggests the presence of overlapping pipelines. I ponder if the vertical pipeline of '1's takes priority over the horizontal '3's due to its placement.\n\nMoving to the next example, I note '1's in row 0 among '6's and how their output fills horizontally, while '2's form a vertical pipeline. I'll need to keep verifying these patterns with more examples!",
