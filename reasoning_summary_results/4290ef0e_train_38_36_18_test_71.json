By removing the background, I\u2019m focusing on the interesting area defined by those values. Rows 5 to 8 showcase non-5 content, which I need to extract. Specifically, I\u2019m identifying columns 3 through 8 as containing the relevant values. This helps me determine the shape created by the arrangement of 2s and 1s.**Examining column patterns**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that column 3 in my input always has the value 2, while columns 4 to 6 have a mix of 2s and 5s, and columns 7 is also 2. I\u2019m trying to work with output patterns where it seems they replaced 5s with 1s in certain areas. For example, in the output, row 3 takes values from the corresponding input row but swaps 5s for 1s in specific positions. The borders are filled with 2s, while the center has 5s and 1s creatively adjusted.**Identifying shape patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the grid and noticing several distinct shapes. There are 4s forming a frame but missing the bottom row, while 0s appear in another area. The goal is to take the frame and fill it with the plus shape from a different region. The 4s align in rows 1-4, but it seems I need to reflect the top row to complete the 5x5 frame. For the second example, there's a similar frame with 2s, needing to fill it with the 1s from the interior, creating a hollow square. So, I\u2019ll assemble these shapes.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m refining the output based on the frame and interior shapes. Rows 5 through 8 of the input form the frame, while I'll add row 9 to complete the bottom. It seems I need to replace certain interior positions with a smaller shape from rows 6 to 8. For example, the frame remains intact, but I will carefully insert the smaller frame shapes where needed. \n\nThe final output should look like this:\n44444\n46664\n46864\n46664\n44444. \n\nThis maintains symmetry and clearly showcases the frame and interior elements.",
