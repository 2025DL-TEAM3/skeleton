In the third example input, the stripe at column 4 is consistent across rows, always having a 6. However, the output changes the second row at column 4 from 6 to 4, breaking that stripe. So it seems they removed the stripe instance in row 2, which is puzzling!**Understanding stripe removal**\n\nI'm considering how to handle the stripes when a row is distinct. In example 3, row 2 stands out with its values compared to rows 1, 3, and 4. For example 2, row 2 is different too, so I need to modify the stripes in those unique rows accordingly. In example 1, row 3 has a break in the stripe pattern, so I should change the stripe color to match other rows while preserving uniqueness. However, I wonder if I need to adjust the approach if the stripe color aligns with the row's color. It\u2019s tricky!**Clarifying stripe adjustments**\n\nIt seems they fixed the issue by changing a cell from 2 to 0, restoring the stripe. In example 2, all rows initially had a consistent stripe of 3\u2019s. However, changing row 2's stripe from 3 to 5 breaks that consistent pattern. In example 3, they also altered a stripe of 6 to 4 specifically at row 2. The rule appears to be about maintaining the dominant color in unique rows while adjusting stripes. Overall, if there's a break in a unique row, they either restore or remove the stripe to preserve visual consistency.**Applying intersection rules**\n\nIn example 3, we have vertical and horizontal stripes with colors 6 and 4, respectively. The intersection at row 2, column 4 shows a value of 6, indicating the horizontal stripe is broken. The rule seems to be about identifying these unique colors in columns and rows. In the input grid I examined, column 2 had a consistent color of 5, forming a vertical stripe, while row 2 had a mix but centered around 0. I replaced the intersection with the horizontal stripe color, resulting in a transformed grid that fits all previous examples.",
