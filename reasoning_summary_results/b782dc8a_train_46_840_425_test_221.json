    "reasoning": "**Visualizing patterns**\n\nI'm considering how to visualize a shape combining zeros and sixes. For example, in Row 1, all sixes are uniform. In Row 2, all zeros shift to an alternating pattern of twos and fives until reaching the six. \n\nThe overall structure allows these interior zeros to be re-colored with new colors. So, as we go through each row, it transforms the zeros into twos and fives, creating interesting patterns throughout. I'm curious how effective this visualization will be!**Analyzing input patterns**\n\nI\u2019m examining an alternating pattern found in a new shape that involves numbers like 9s, 7s, 5s, and occasionally 6s. For instance, in Input2, I find a structure mostly composed of nines and sevens, but five appears in certain positions.\n\nLooking closely, it seems the output introduces a six, replacing sevens with fives but preserving the nines. Overall, rows 2 to 6 have been altered within a region bounded by sixes while keeping the outer frame intact. It\u2019s interesting how some rows change depending on this pattern!**Examining border patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing shape patterns in input3, where a border of 9s and 7s exists, including a zigzag formation of 7s that get replaced by alternating 5s and 6s based on parity. As I check the replacements, it appears that if the sum of the row and column indices is even, it's 5, while odd gives a 6, which seems consistent as I verify various positions.\n\nHowever, I'm noting that some zeros are untouched if they're adjacent to existing borders. It seems like there are conditions around which zeros get replaced\u2014mostly those completely enclosed by the 6s. I need to clarify the rules on these replacements!**Exploring BFS and output transformation**\n\nI'm starting a breadth-first search (BFS) from seed positions in the grid, specifically focusing on the zeros connected to those seeds. The BFS can only maneuver through the zero cells, avoiding walls marked by '2'. I\u2019ll check the zeros covered by the BFS, including rows 1 through 7. \n\nNext, I'll transform the grid so that each zero is replaced based on the parity of its coordinates. If the cell's sum is even, it gets a 7; if odd, it gets a 9. Finally, I'll ensure that all non-zero cells remain unchanged and summarize the constructed output.",
