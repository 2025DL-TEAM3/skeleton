My task is to understand the rules governing the mapping from input to output grids. I\u2019ll look for patterns or consistent transformations, such as addition, multiplication, or any changes in position. Figuring out the transformation will be key to solving the puzzle! Let's break it down step by step.**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at the first example provided, which consists of input and output numerical grids. I want to identify any symmetrical replacements or patterns in the mappings. For instance, in the second row, I see that the value in column 1 changes from 3 to 5, and the last column changes from 3 to 5 as well. I\u2019ll continue comparing each row and examining the differences, keeping track of any consistent changes throughout the grid.**Applying the diagonal fill rule**\n\nI see that the center digit of the grid is '0' at position (2,3), which means I need to fill the diagonals based on this. The grid size is 5 rows by 7 columns. I\u2019ll determine which cells to change by finding positions where the absolute difference satisfies the fill rule. After identifying the appropriate indices, I can update the grid row by row. The final output should consist of 7-digit strings for each row, clearly showing the transformed grid.",
