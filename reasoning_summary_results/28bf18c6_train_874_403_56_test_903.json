It seems like I\u2019m subtracting dimensions inconsistently. The 7x8 input reduces the rows by 2, leading to a 5x6 output, but the column adjustments aren't adding up. This inconsistency prompts me to reconsider the structure of the inputs, possibly involving blocks with colored borders affecting the internal patterns. I'll need a closer look!**Examining grid outputs**\n\nIt looks like the output takes non-background digits by removing the border. In the first example, the grid mainly features 9s with a single 0 at coordinates (0,1), resulting in an output of \"00.\" In the second example, there's a 6x6 grid where 7 forms a shape across rows 1 and 2. This 2x4 shape in the output doubles horizontally, with the first row mirroring the second. It's intriguing to see how these patterns emerge! I'll have to analyze the third example further for similar patterns.**Mapping bounding boxes**\n\nI'm identifying regions of 6s in a grid, forming a connected block that might be 5 rows high and 3 columns wide. The 6s appear between rows 0 and 4. When I extract the bounding rectangle of those 6s, I create a 5x3 grid. In the output, this 5-row block gets repeated horizontally to form a 5x6 grid. It looks like the rule is to extract the smallest rectangle of non-background cells, then tile it. I'll check for consistency with the next example to ensure this understanding holds!**Finalizing output format**\n\nThe output I\u2019m working on should be presented in two lines: \n\n```\n44774477\n47444744\n```\n\nI\u2019m double-checking the pattern: the first row is correct as [4,4,7,7,4,4,7,7], and the second row is [4,7,4,4,4,7,4,4]. It seems all predictions align perfectly. I've reviewed previous examples, and despite not finding any vertical tiling, the horizontal doubling is confirmed. So yes, the output is set, and I'm ready to return the grid. Done!",
