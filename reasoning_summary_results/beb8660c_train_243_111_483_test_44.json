    "reasoning": "**Analyzing column arrangement**\n\nI noticed that they moved the 4 shape to be next to the 8s in column 4. In my example, column 4 is filled with 8s, creating a right-side border. The 4 shape is now in column 3, just to the left of column 4. The 8s fill every row in column 4, but there aren't any 8s above or below\u2014only in that column. The 4 was moved to row 0, probably to stay close to the 8 border.**Understanding shape movement**\n\nIt seems they've moved the shape to align with the border created by a constant color region. The rule appears to be placing a colored shape next to this distinct color border. In my examples, the 8s create a horizontal border at row 0 and row 7, with the 2 shape below and the 3000 shape above. Generally, I identify the color (8) by the border and slide the distinct shape toward it. In one instance, I noticed they moved the shape to row 0 instead of the middle, which makes me wonder if they intended to reflect the shape across the barrier.**Exploring shape movement rules**\n\nI was thinking about reflecting a shape across column 4, which seemed tricky since the grid isn't wide enough. Instead, I noticed each training has two colors: the pattern and the border. Patterns move to an adjacent cell next to the border on the opposite side. In one example, they moved the pattern to col3, but I questioned why they selected row0 as the choice instead of row1. It seems they favor placing the pattern in the topmost available space. In another, shapes shifted left to be contiguous with the left border. The general rule here appears to involve identifying borders and adjusting the patterns accordingly.",
