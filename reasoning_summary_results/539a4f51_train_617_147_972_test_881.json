The input for this example is a 2x2 grid with values 7 and 6. It\u2019s clear that only nonzero values, which are 6 and 7 here, should be included in the output. From previous examples, it looks like the output grid should consist of these highest colors, ignoring any zeros that represent the background. So, I plan to create a 4x4 grid featuring only 6 and 7.**Creating a 4x4 grid**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on producing a 4x4 grid using colors 6 and 7, where 6 is the lowest (C1) and 7 is the highest (C2). The pattern from earlier examples suggests diagonally alternating stripes. In this case, row 0 will be all 6s. For row 1, I\u2019ll place three 7s and end with a 6. Row 2 could follow a pattern with two 6s, then a 7, and a final 6. This structure captures the diagonal essence seen before while accommodating the smaller grid size.**Constructing the 4x4 grid**\n\nI\u2019m working on creating a 4x4 output grid using a block pattern learned from previous examples. The rule involves setting block rows and columns. Each block row will depend on the conditions from the input values, where I\u2019ll check if the previous cells match the highest color. \n\nFor the input:\n(0,0)=7, (0,1)=7, (1,0)=6, (1,1)=7, C1=6 and C2=7, I\u2019ll construct the resultant grid as:\n\n```\n6767\n6767\n7777\n6667\n```\n\nThis pattern seems to align with what I've discovered.",
