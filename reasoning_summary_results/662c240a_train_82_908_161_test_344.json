For the examples, it seems the rule is to always cut the larger dimension in half. In two cases, since width is greater, they keep the left half. But when height is larger, they retain the bottom half. There\u2019s a pattern emerging where they preserve the first half in that dimension, so for rows, it would mean keeping the top ones.**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI'm trying to understand why they kept the bottom three rows while dropping others. It seems there's no strict rule about always keeping the first half. Perhaps they focus on the region with the most varied patterns instead. For example, with the rows, the last three\u2014containing different digits\u2014are chosen, hinting at some underlying structure. When inspecting columns, it looks like the left half may be more consistent overall. It\u2019s fascinating to consider patterns, though it's a bit tricky to pinpoint a definitive rule!",
