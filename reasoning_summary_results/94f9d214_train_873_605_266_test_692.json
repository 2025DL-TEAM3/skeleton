    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid changes**\n\nI\u2019m considering the cell values and their surroundings. For instance, in row 2, the coordinates [9,9] give a value of 2, while in row 1, the same coordinates yield 5. Could it be due to the surrounding rows indicating a hole? I\u2019m noticing a rectangle shape forms with the 9s. The mapping might depend on whether neighboring colors are the same. The rule could be: if neighbors above and below match, output background color; otherwise, use marker color.**Evaluating cell pairs**\n\nIf two cells in row 2 are part of a 2x2 square of the same color (let's say 9), indicating they\u2019re interior cells rather than outlines, then both surrounding cells must match. For row 2, column 3, I'm noting that rows 1-3 all have the color 9, so they form the interior of a rectangle. Therefore, they map to 2. However, row 1, which has a different surrounding configuration, maps to 5. I think I\u2019ll establish a rule for identifying the interior of the largest uniform rectangle for any color and marking borders distinctly.**Identifying flagged pairs**\n\nI\u2019m tracking flagged pairs of cells. We have pairs like (41) at (row1,1) and (row6,1), (55) at (row3,3) and (row7,3), and so on. I'm seeing a total of 9 flagged pairs, suggesting a symmetric pattern. When plotting these positions, I notice they might outline a region shaped by the 2s. The pattern resembles an X shape. However, I'm questioning if this pattern indicates a diamond shape or perhaps relates to the region of 1s, as I explore the coordinates further. It feels like I should inspect the symmetry more closely.",
