    "reasoning": "**Analyzing coordinates**\n\nI'm looking at coordinates for two points: A = (4,2) and B = (4,9). It seems they create mirrored shapes around a central seed. The pyramid-like shape has regions of \"4\" distributed across different rows. \n\nI've plotted these coordinates for \"4,\" and they do appear symmetric. Next, I need to compute distances from point A using Manhattan distances for each relevant coordinate, confirming the shape resembles a diamond centered around A. It seems like I may have established a pattern in these distances.**Exploring distances and symmetry**\n\nI'm examining points at varying distances, specifically 0 to 5, and noticing some peculiarities. The points at distance 5 are at (2,5) and (6,5) but not at (5,7). It seems like there are two arms extending rightward, resembling an arrow pointing that way, suggesting a drawn line connecting the central points. \n\nLooking at the distances associated with 5s, they do appear to form symmetrical shapes around point B=(4,9). The offsets reveal a structured pattern that corresponds nicely with the 4s. The layout presents a mirrored symmetry, which I find fascinating!**Defining shapes and coordinates**\n\nI\u2019m examining the shapes formed around two seeds and their symmetry. The shapes for values 4 and 5 seem identical but mirrored around a vertical axis. For the shape defined by 4, I created relative coordinates based on a seed at (4,2), producing a cluster of points. \n\nWhen examining the value 5, I mirrored these coordinates horizontally to reflect the positions relative to the seed at (4,9). I\u2019m noticing how the rules apply, producing two mirrored patterns that maintain their structure around the respective seeds. I\u2019m also checking how the coordinates fit within grid boundaries; it\u2019s crucial that they remain valid!",
