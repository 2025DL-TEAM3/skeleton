The first example suggests reducing repeated characters in each row. In subsequent examples, it becomes clear that rows contain three repetitions of a three-character pattern, so the output keeps only the first occurrence. The last example reinforces this by compressing a triple digit into a single character. I think the general rule is to remove consecutive repeats, focusing on substrings.**Determining the substring rule**\n\nI\u2019m identifying a pattern where if the length of a string is divisible by three and if it\u2019s composed of a substring repeated three times, then I should output just that substring. For example, with the input rows like \"748748748,\" I see that \"748\" is repeated three times, leading to an output of \"748.\" Similarly, the string \"888888888\" allows for the substring \"888\" to be extracted. I find the output from the grid results in five rows: 748, 103, 888, 888, 804.",
