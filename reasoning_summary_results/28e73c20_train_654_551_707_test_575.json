    "reasoning": "**Analyzing row values**\n\nI'm checking how the last occurrence of values in a row may be preserved. For example, in row 3 with values like 5, 7, and 2, the last occurrence of 5 appears in column 3, which remains. However, the last occurrence of 7 is in column 2, but there's a contradiction with column 3. To clarify, perhaps I should test that in each group of identical digits, only the rightmost one stays the same while others change to 3. It seems groups aren't contiguous, so I need to focus on identifying the most frequent digit in each row instead.**Analyzing row outputs**\n\nI'm examining the values in different rows to ascertain why certain columns change while others stay the same. For instance, in Row 8, where the input changes lead to a unique output for column 2 and 3 but alter column 4. The approach seems inconsistent since some rows retain the third column, while others don't.\n\nWith further analysis, it looks like most rows maintain the third column's values unless it appears less frequently. Interesting; maybe I should evaluate the entire 2D grid and not just focus on each row independently.**Exploring grid shapes**\n\nI'm examining three training shapes: training 1 is L-shaped, training 2 is a rectangular loop, and training 3 features a 4x4 grid all filled with 7s, resulting in preserved values. For the 4x4 grid, only specific columns in rows 2 and 3 retain values while others change. Remarkably, the outputs from training 3 match part of the larger training 1 L shape. It seems each grid has unique preservation patterns, leading me to think about how to consistently identify shapes across various configurations. I might focus on the uniformity of patterns to outline a rule for detecting these shapes.",
