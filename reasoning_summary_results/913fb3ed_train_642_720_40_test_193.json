If column 1 remains 7 while columns 2 and 3 change to 4, it suggests only those two columns were adjusted. It seems like there's a pattern of filling a cross shape centered on a number, preserving it while altering the orthogonal neighbors. For example, at (4,3), the center cell is 8, and changes to its neighbors reflect this concept.**Understanding anomaly detection**\n\nAlright, so I see that for r6, the value is 444, and checking the second row of the template gives me 4, 8, 4, leading to 484. In example 3, I'm looking at the grid. The only cell differing from 5s is at (1,4) where there's a 2. This means the anomaly is where the unique value '2' is, and it centers the template around (1,4). \n\nThe generated template must clip to fit the grid, which makes me question why they switched to using 1s around the 2 instead of 4s as seen in prior examples. It seems now they surround the anomaly with half its value: 2 becomes 1; 8 becomes 4. I\u2019ll test this understanding further with example 3's expected output to validate this pattern!**Applying the template for anomalies**\n\nI'm working on applying a 3x3 template around anomalies in a grid. I've identified the unique anomalies: a single 8 at (5,2) and two 2s that occur twice. Since only the unique anomaly gets processed according to my previous examples, I\u2019ll apply the template centered on (5,2).\n\nThe hollow template fills the surrounding cells with half the anomaly's value. This means I\u2019ll adjust rows 4 and 5 while keeping the rest unchanged. After applying the template, the final output grid is:\n\n777777727\n777777777\n777777777\n444777277\n484777777\n\nNow I've confirmed that I correctly managed not to modify the duplicate 2s since only the unique 8 was addressed!",
