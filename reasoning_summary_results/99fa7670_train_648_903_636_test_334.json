    "reasoning": "**Analyzing anomaly rows**\n\nI'm observing a pattern with rows following anomaly rows. For each anomaly, all subsequent rows until the next anomaly only have the rare digit in the last column. For example, between the first anomaly row and the fourth row, rows two and three show the rare digit 3 only in the last column. Row four is another anomaly, followed by row five, which is also marked as an anomaly. Between row five and eight, rows six and seven contain the digit 3. Finally, row nine includes the digit 4 as per row eight's anomaly.**Transforming anomaly rows**\n\nI\u2019m noting that rows 1, 4, 5, and 8 are the anomalous ones. For these rows, I need to fill the suffix with the rare digit. The rest will remain unchanged, but the last cell will get updated to the rare digit from the nearest anomaly above. For example, row 3 gets its last column value from row 1\u2019s rare digit, which is 3. Rows 6 and 7 pick the rare digit from row 5, and row 9 takes from row 8. Overall, I have a clear set of rules to follow.**Applying transformation rules**\n\nI'm working through the rows to identify anomalies: rows 1, 4, 8, and 10 are anomalies based on their rare digits. Rows 6 and 7 get the rare digit of row 5, which is 2, in their last column. Row 8 has the rare digit 9, so I fill from its column to the end. For row 9 and 10, the last column gets updated to 9 from row 8. For the rules, non-anomalous rows receive the last rare digit from preceding anomalies. I\u2019ll summarize the approach to transformation systematically.**Finalizing the grid output**\n\nRow 4 is an anomaly with a rare digit of 5 at column 3, so I fill from that column onwards, resulting in '665555555'. Rows 5 to 7 are non-anomalies; I set their last cell to 5, generating '666666665' for each. Row 8 is another anomaly, with a rare digit of 5 at column 8, producing '666666655'. Row 9 receives the rare digit 5 in its last cell while Row 10, with 7 as its rare digit, becomes '777777777'. I\u2019ve confirmed the grid dimensions and will output the final result.",
