For input row0, when inserting zeros, I see the output row2 as \"555000555.\" That seems to combine row0, zeros, and then again row0. For other inputs, the pattern involves repeating rows horizontally, with variations in zeros for the central column. It looks like for each input row, I'm generating two output rows: one solid and one with a variation. Breaking it down into blocks of size 1x3 could help clarify this structure.**Exploring output dimensions**\n\nI'm generalizing the relationship between input shapes and output dimensions. Based on examples, for input shape A with R rows and C columns, the output dimensions seem to follow a 2R by 3C pattern. However, example discrepancies show that not all inputs fit this. It seems output dimensions can actually be represented as (R\u00b2) x (C\u00b2). I'm hypothesizing that an outer product approach is involved, where each output element is derived from specific combinations of input values, perhaps using minimum values from comparisons. I'll keep testing to match outputs.",
