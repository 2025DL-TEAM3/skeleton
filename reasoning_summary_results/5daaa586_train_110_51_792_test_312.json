For example, given inputs of 10x10, 10x8, and 10x6, it looks like the output width is consistently 4, while the height adjusts based on the input width's patterns.\n\nI'm beginning to think that output height could relate to the number of rows differing from the majority pattern. I will closely examine the input row transitions and how they fit together to track these differences. There's definitely a lot to dig into!**Identifying row anomalies**\n\nI'm diving into the rows and noticing various anomalies, like how '9962989' at row 3 differs from the base pattern. The grid mostly aligns with '9969989', but there are local differences. I think I need to capture the specifics of these differences, noting the altered digits and their positions.\n\nFor instance, row 2 shows five differing positions against the base. It's tricky but I need to catalog these anomalies systematically and see how they relate to the base pattern. I'll focus on how these variations translate into the output rows that begin with '6'.**Determining output order**\n\nI\u2019m focusing on the output order for the unique rows based on their first appearance. The current outputs are '6998', '6558', '6228', and '6298', but they don\u2019t seem sorted. It looks like I should prioritize row counts and then first appearances.\n\nSo, I\u2019ll establish a list of unique substrings in the order they first appear: '1144', '4144', '2122', '0000'. I think I\u2019ll use this order to structure my final output, ensuring clarity despite the initial confusion.",
