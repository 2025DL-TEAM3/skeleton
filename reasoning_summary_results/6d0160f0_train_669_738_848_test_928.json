    "reasoning": "**Finding patterns in numbers**\n\nI'm trying to determine whether to focus on the row with the most repeated digits or the one with the maximal sum. For example, the row 11111 is less interesting due to having all the same digits. The rows 77174 and 77173 feature two 7s at the start, indicating higher similarity. I think it makes sense to choose the most common two-digit prefix, '77'. I could transform non-similar rows to share that prefix while preserving the last digits, focusing on the '122' pattern for other rows.**Identifying patterns for transformation**\n\nI'm exploring why the row 11111 doesn\u2019t change to match the prefix, '77'. It seems uniform rows like that don\u2019t change. For non-uniform rows, I should identify a repeating pattern in prefixes or suffixes to transform other rows accordingly. The row 88888, for instance, didn\u2019t change either. \n\nIn case 1, the repeating prefix is '228', and I see some rows transforming to follow this, using '22' as a suffix. It looks like I need to consider the most common digits in certain positions to determine patterns, especially focusing on suffix choices based on frequency.**Analyzing color patterns in rows**\n\nI'm working on identifying patterns among input rows, particularly focusing on the digit '2' and how it appears. Rows like 62122 don't seem uniform since '2' shows up multiple times in some columns. I want to count the frequency of '2' and other digits across the grid. For instance, in the first grid, '2' appears frequently as well as '8', but both tie in counts. \n\nIt seems I may need to transform rows based on this frequency, but I must also decide how to treat rows with mixed colors, especially regarding preserving important digits like '8'. It\u2019s intricate, but the goal is to recolor everything to find clarity!**Predicting output structure**\n\nIn case two, there's a tie in column one with no clear mode, so they choose the smaller digit, resulting in some conflicting output. For column five, where there's a tie between 1 and 0, they choose 0. Therefore, the predicted output could look like this:\n\n10300\n10300\n33333\n10300\n10300\n\nThis suggests that they primarily preserve identical rows while changing the others to match the most frequent row, which is 10300. Given the rules, it seems the output maintains a pattern, leading to the same result for most rows except for the uniform one, 33333.",
