Analyzing these details is crucial for my understanding!**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI'm examining the grid for positions where the output is zero, particularly in the first two rows. They show a 2x2 square of zeros in columns 3 and 4, indicating a unique section of all zeros.\n\nI\u2019m considering if this means there\u2019s a larger connected block of zeros surrounded by threes. Next, I'm looking at a 9x10 grid where zeroes aren't present, and a few patterns emerge\u2014like mapping major and minor colors. I notice that in some cases, adjacent values seem to affect the output. It's all quite intriguing!**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing various rows and their outputs. For instance, in row three, inputting several fours leads to ones in the output, meaning that any row with a four transforms entirely. This is intriguing because it suggests adjacent values determine output changes. \n\nMoving on to another example with combinations of threes and nines, it seems like some threes remain while nines are converted to ones, possibly indicating a pattern where the first occurrence is retained, while others change. This leads me to think about the connected components and how they interact with one another!",
