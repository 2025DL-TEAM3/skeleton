Each 2x2 section in the input creates a macrocell, which corresponds to a quadrant in output. For example, if I have an input macrocell that contains all 7s, it indicates the output quadrant will also be colored 7. I wonder if there\u2019s a difference in scaling factors for horizontal or vertical sections. That\u2019s an intriguing concept!**Examining macrocell outputs**\n\nIn mapping macros, I'm considering macrocell (0,1) where the input shows uniform values of 7. This means that the top right quadrant outputs all 7s. The output creates a grid of quadrants, each 4x4 in size. Each quadrant color comes from specific input samples, like the uniform color or the different pixel in a 2x2 block. For example, I'll sample at the coordinates (1,1), (1,3), (3,1), and (3,3). Testing examples shows that this approach generates consistent output patterns.",
