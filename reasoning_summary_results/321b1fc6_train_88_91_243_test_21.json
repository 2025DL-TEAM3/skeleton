    "reasoning": "**Analyzing zero patterns**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that they have two zeros in a row at columns 2 and 3 for one row. In row 2 with \"99009999,\" the zeros are specifically in columns 2 and 3, while in row 3 with \"99000999,\" the zeros appear in columns 2, 3, and 4. This seems to be a miscount, but it gets trickier with later rows. I see the output transformations indicate replacements of those initial zeros with other digits, which raises some questions about the original numbers.**Examining digit propagation**\n\nIn the output, row 2 shows \"99539999\", and row 3 shows \"99758999.\" This matches the input from row 6 and row 7, respectively. It seems like they're propagating certain digits upward in a way where colored digits form a shape while zeros are blank. The zeros get replaced by these colored digits following a path traced by the zeros itself. \n\nWhen I analyze the layout closely, it looks like I need to ensure I track these paths and how they fill the shapes created by the zeroes.**Understanding example correlations**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that example 3 doesn't relate to example 1 directly. However, they may share an underlying transformation rule based on the problem's structure. For example 2, it seems the shape uses specific colors, maybe with some ambiguous background. Testing various colors could help pinpoint what fills the blanks. I think the key rule across examples is identifying colors that appear a certain number of times, then copying those patterns to contiguous background regions, possibly addressing holes too.**Constructing shape grids**\n\nI'm examining a shape grid of size 3x5 positioned at specific rows and columns. The shape contains values that aren't 8, so I'll only copy those onto the output grid. For the output, I'll start with a grid filled with 8's, and then replace those with the copied values at their new positions. \n\nTop and bottom copies will be made without shifting columns, which gives a symmetrical placement. As I build the output rows, I'll ensure the values replace the appropriate cells to reflect the shape pattern accurately. The predicted output grid shows this duplication rule clearly.",
