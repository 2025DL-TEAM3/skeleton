Looking at example 3 more closely, the input shows 8s represented in the output as a diagonal pattern.\n\nIn each row of the output, I see where the 8s are located. I wonder if these positions result from overlapping rectangles. This connection might help uncover more about the shapes forming in the input data. Let's explore further!**Analyzing shape distributions**\n\nIn input example 3, I see two shapes: the top half has zeros and sixes while the bottom half features ones and twos. The sixes appear prominently in rows 2 and 4. \n\nI've located their coordinates, which might create a specific shape, potentially a mirror in the bottom as twos also share a pattern. The output only covers four rows, likely corresponding to the top half, and I'm trying to understand how the shapes interact or overlap based on their distributions to reveal insight into this projection.**Examining shapes in example 2**\n\nIn example 2, I see distinct shapes: the top four rows only contain zeros and sixes, while the bottom five rows have ones and fives. The output appears to transform sixes into eights. Analyzing this pattern, it looks like the clusters of sixes may form a symmetric shape, marking a center line at column 4.\n\nThe output includes eights that don\u2019t seem to have a direct mapping from the sixes. Instead, it\u2019s as if the output reflects a relationship between shapes in both halves, potentially showing overlaps or symmetry in the grid. I\u2019ll have to consider how these shapes interact further!**Reflecting on shape overlaps**\n\nIt seems like the new input has two shapes sharing a color, leading me to think that they might reflect each other. I noticed the top region has a 3's pattern, while the bottom region shows a similar but transposed cluster. Upon comparison, these shapes actually differ.\n\nGiven that there's uncertainty and based on the instructions, I\u2019ll decide to output four rows of \"00000\". It feels a bit simplistic, but I don't see a clear directive for a different outcome. So, I'll stick to my conclusion!",
