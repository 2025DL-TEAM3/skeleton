It looks like the first five digits from row 9 are 5 5 6 5 5. So, I can see I need to find the unique row and extract values until reaching a non-background section.\n\nFor instance, with another example, I look at different rows that contain repeated values but have one distinct one, like row 1 starting with 8 while others are primarily 4s.**Identifying prefixes and backgrounds**\n\nI've concluded that the prefix in the example is 8 because it's the first number before any 4. So, my rule is to find rows where unique patterns emerge before the background colors start. In this case, the background seems to be formed by the most frequent color.\n\nIn the analysis, it looks like zeros create a rectangle in certain rows. Counts show that 5s are more common, but zeros also appear frequently. So the background is marked by zeros, making the prefixes surrounding them from 5s and 6s until hitting a background.**Understanding grid backgrounds and prefixes**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid that's 8 columns wide and 9 rows tall, focusing on a rectangle of zeros spanning columns 5 and 6. This forms a consistent background, while other areas show non-zero values. In row 9, zeros appear, but the 5 at position 7 is outside this rectangle. \n\nThe zeros constitute the majority background, while in a second example, the background is characterized by 4s, forming a rectangular region. The rule is to identify the unique row that differs from uniform rows, then extract the prefix until hitting the first occurrence of the most common color in that row.",
