    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the grid problem**\n\nI'm focused on a grid-style puzzle involving numbers. The example shows an input grid that has 9 rows and 8 columns. It appears that the main digit is 7, but there are other digits sprinkled throughout. I notice that the output reflects some form of mutation based on these non-7 digits, possibly by swapping them with their nearest counterparts in the same row or column. It seems like a transformation while maintaining the grid's shape, where 7s dominate the background.**Exploring the non-7 pattern**\n\nI'm noticing a diagonal loop formed by the non-7 cells surrounding a cluster of 7s. It seems like the digits create a path that connects these endpoints while also potentially propagating through the 7s. I\u2019ve counted the non-7 coordinates in the input and found 8 positions. The output appears to maintain this count but also introduces new values around the center. It\u2019s as if the digits are swirling clockwise around the 7 perimeter, creating a circular pattern around that 7 block.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI'm working on filling a grid based on specific coordinates and values derived from the input. I begin by marking positions for the value 5, followed by filling in for the value 3. After mapping out where to place these, the grid starts with the original input, and I carefully replace certain positions according to my calculations. \n\nAfter thoroughly checking each row, I confirm the final output grid with accurate placements. Ultimately, I compile the completed rows, ensuring all alterations reflect the intended transformations accurately.",
