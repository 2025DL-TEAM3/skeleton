    "reasoning": "**Refining output rows**\n\nI think a better approach would be to pinpoint the special row that has two colors and keep that row unchanged in the output. After identifying it, I\u2019ll discard that row. For the area above that row, I can fill the cells with one of the two new colors based on which region is larger. In example 1, the upper region has 1 row, while the lower region has 5 rows. It\u2019s important to maintain consistency in color application across the columns.**Analyzing fill rules**\n\nSo, in the first example, the input row has repeated 7s and the output has a mix with ones. The preserved columns seem to be the first two while the others are filled with 1s. The anomaly row introduces columns to consider. Above that, columns are preserved, while below gets a different treatment. In the second example, it seems they filled all columns above with 3, not preserving non-anomaly columns. In the end, I need to clarify fill rules for both regions consistently.**Deciding on filling strategy**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to fill regions based on special rows. Below one row, the small block at column 5 is filled with 6, but the output shows 3 or 1 instead, which doesn\u2019t match expectations. It seems like for each block of the special row, I should use different colors above and below. Generally, I think the minority color will fill one region, while the majority fills the other. In looking at multiple examples, the rule seems to alternate based on size \u2014 smaller regions get one color and larger regions get another.**Analyzing filling patterns**\n\nI'm looking at how to preserve and fill columns in different regions based on a special row. It seems that for the smaller region, I need to preserve the appropriate columns and fill the rest with a specific color. The patterns appear inconsistent at times, especially when checking examples \u2014 maybe some mistakes exist in the given ones. Ultimately, I want to establish a clearer set of rules: identify the special row, determine regions above and below, and consistently apply filling rules based on the size of those regions.",
