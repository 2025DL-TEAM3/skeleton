    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit replacement and counting**\n\nIt looks like I\u2019m working on understanding how the digit replacement and character counting function. For row 3, column 8, I see that 8 changes to 1, which affects the 7 in row 4, changing it to 1 as well. As I count through the digits in the inputs, I realize I'm ending up with a total of 10 characters. I noticed I need to ensure I'm indexing properly and keeping track of those digit groups accurately. Let's clarify this tracking!**Examining digit patterns and changes**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the digit replacements in each row. For row 2, I'm seeing that the input \"8888888800\" results in \"8888888100\" due to an 8 changing to a 1 at column 7. Then for row 3, I note the 7 transforms into an 8, keeping the structure intact for the output. It appears that when a 7 is adjacent to 8, it results in a change. Row 4 shows no addition of 1 because there wasn't an 8 next to the 7. The goal seems to be restoring the rectangular shape made by the 8s.**Analyzing hole filling and marking**\n\nI\u2019m looking into how to fill in holes while marking their reflections. Each hole needs to be filled with 8s, and then I need to identify and mark specific positions based on reflections. For instance, holes at (3,6) and (4,6) result in markers at (2,7) and (3,7) after considering concavity. It seems they mark the \"roof\" of the concavity instead of adjacent holes. With examples 2 and 3, I\u2019m noting how the concave shapes form and where to mark. Understanding these patterns is key!**Finding border segments of shape cells**\n\nI\u2019m identifying the connected segments of border shape cells after filling the grid. The filled grid shows rows filled with 2s, and I need to check which shape cells are adjacent to the background value of 0. Each shape cell will be evaluated for its neighbors to form connected segments. The significant border segment identified has a size of 5 at column 8 across several rows. I\u2019ll update those specific grid cells to 1, maintaining the integrity of the shape while marking the border correctly.",
