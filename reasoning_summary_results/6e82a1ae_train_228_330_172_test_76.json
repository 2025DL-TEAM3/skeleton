    "reasoning": "**Analyzing mapping patterns**\n\nI think I\u2019m looking at the mapping of numbers in a specific context. The first row shows (0,4) with an output of 3. The second row mirrors this pattern, while the third and subsequent rows reveal variations. I notice that 7 maps differently depending on its location, sometimes to 1, 2, or 3. It's interesting how 7s in certain rows trigger different outputs based on surrounding numbers. The shapes created by 7s are colored differently within their context.**Visualizing input and output**\n\nLet's break down the first example input to see how the numbers map to new outputs. The rows contain 7s and 6s, with 7s forming distinct shapes. I notice that clusters of connected 7s\u2014like (0,0),(0,1),(1,0)\u2014determine their sizes, which get recolored in the output. The cluster sizes translate into new numbers based on their sizes: for instance, size 3 becomes 2, size 2 becomes 3, and size 4 turns into 1. Moving on to the second input, the majority are 4s with some 8s needing recoloring.**Mapping color patterns**\n\nI'm looking into how shapes are mapped to colors based on their position within a grid. My thought is that each shape could be colored differently, depending on its proximity to background regions. I\u2019m trying to determine clusters within the rows and see how they correspond to color bands. In the second example, I notice that shapes in various row and column segments might have varying colors depending on their size and position. I keep getting inconsistent mappings in the bottom band, suggesting that different areas might indeed have distinct rules.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing the clusters for each row to determine their new colors. For Row 0, I see that positions within the clusters should map to new colors, like changing (0,0) in a size 2 cluster to 3. Row 1 has its clusters similar, and Row 2 has one significant cluster that also maps to 3. In Row 3, I identify multiple clusters with different sizes, leading to another mix of new colors. Finally, I want to ensure each row outputs its values correctly, though I'm feeling a bit uncertain as I finalize my grid.",
