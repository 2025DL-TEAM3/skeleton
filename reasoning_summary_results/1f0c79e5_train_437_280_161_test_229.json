    "reasoning": "**Examining digit transformation**\n\nIt seems like some 9s might be turning into 7s, possibly by rotating shapes between 7s and 2s. It's tricky to see the exact changes at first. I notice that 7s appear where there used to be 2s, possibly reflecting a symmetry around the diagonal. I\u2019m listing the positions of non-9 digits to clarify the pattern, focusing on the coordinates that might inform us about the transformation. It's quite a puzzle that requires careful examination!**Analyzing digit patterns**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the string \"2799999927,\" which has ten digits. The distribution shows a pattern with 2s and 7s forming diagonal lines. Specifically, I see coordinates like (1,2)=2 and (2,1)=2 creating a diagonal symmetric block. The connection seems to be two mirrored diagonal lines, with 7s appended where 2s were previously.\n\nI\u2019ll group the small patterns into distinct blocks. The first block, making a 2x2 identity matrix, shows 7 and 2, while the second block has a similar but rotated orientation. It\u2019s fascinating to see how these structures play off one another!**Understanding block transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing two 2x2 blocks, noting that Block 2 is a shifted version of Block 1, moved down one row and right eight columns. Both blocks maintain the same pattern of 7s and 2s. The output has replaced the 2s in these blocks with additional 7s, creating a thicker diagonal line of 7s rather than just their original positions.\n\nI see a pattern where more cells are filled with 7s in the output than in the input. This means they extended the original block pattern into more areas, converting some 2s into 7s, effectively increasing the overall count of 7s from eight in the input to fifteen in the output.**Analyzing block patterns**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the rules for replicating blocks in the grid. It looks like in example 3, we have a 2x2 block shape replicated along a diagonal, focusing on zero-valued entries. \n\nIn example 1, we place two blocks using a direction determined by their positions. However, the final output appears to have wider stripes, suggesting the blocks are more extensive or perhaps multi-colored. \n\nI\u2019m hypothesizing that to fill in the grid, we use the unique color from specific positions. For the test input, it seems like we fill in cells based on a triangle pattern, ensuring we don\u2019t overwrite existing values unless necessary.**Determining fill colors**\n\nIn this case, the majority color is 2, but instead of filling with more 2s, I'll focus on the unique color, which is 5. The input for row 5 also has 2s, but to follow the pattern from example 2, I'll fill with 5s instead. Looking back, example 2 transitioned a block of 2s to one of 9s, which gives me confidence in this approach. \n\nUltimately, my final output grid will be:\n\n55556  \n55566  \n55666  \n56666  \n22666  \n66666  \n66666\n\nI believe this is correct!",
