It looks like I'm replacing certain digits, specifically placing 3s and 4s in clusters surrounded by 4s or zeros. The second example shows how zeros and 4s interact.\n\nIn the second example, the output features clusters of 3s replacing some of the zeros, outlining a specific pattern formed by 4s. It seems helpful to label the coordinates to better understand the structure!**Labeling matrix coordinates**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a matrix transformation involving numbers, focusing on how certain digits are replaced to form a shape. In the examples, rows, such as 2 and 3, show how zeros are filled with 3s within a cluster of 4s.\n\nIn another example, 7s and 6s create boundaries, where the 3s replace some 7s inside the area marked by 6s. The pattern is intriguing, revealing how these regions interact based on their position and surrounding numbers, forming concave shapes!**Analyzing the transformation rules**\n\nI'm analyzing the transformation rules for a matrix where some digits change under specific conditions. For instance, in one example, '1's in row 2 transform into '3's when they sit between '4's. This makes me think I should identify regions: the largest areas of one digit bounded by another. \n\nIn subsequent examples, the regions of zeros surrounded by '4's also get filled with '3's. It seems important to visualize the shape of these regions to understand how the outputs are formed and which cells are filled!**Examining the filling process**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how to fill certain regions in a grid based on zeros. For instance, I've filled the vertical columns between zeros and checked for any horizontal gaps. This includes filling specific rows in columns where there are adjacent zeros.\n\nUltimately, I want to ensure that the filled areas form a coherent pattern with a specific color, which connects the zeros logically. The final grid reflects this pattern nicely, showing how filled areas link the original zeros.",
