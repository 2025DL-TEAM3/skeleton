    "reasoning": "**Analyzing cell value propagation**\n\nIf I don't find a different cell, I should change only the last cell to a new value, which likely comes from the next row. In rows 5-7, there were no different cells, so they copied positions from row 4, changing the last cell to 2. This 2 came from position 7 in row 4, indicating there's a downward propagation of values. I see there are certain highlighted features to consider: in example 2, the colors 9 and 2 have specific roles in this propagation process.**Understanding cell propagation patterns**\n\nThe 2 at column 1 fills the entire row when it propagates right. The 9 in row 2 at column 7 also spreads to columns 7-10. Similarly, the 2 in row 4 at column 7 propagates rightward. For rows 5-7, lacking distinctive values, they seem to inherit from the row above, with column 7 acting as a boundary. However, row 5 shows a specific output: 3333333332, where only column 10 has a 2. This prompts me to rethink how to identify distinctive markers, especially when scanning columns for non-uniform values across the grid.**Clarifying wave propagation algorithm**\n\nI'm looking into how the propagation of colors works in rows. The algorithm suggests that for each row, I should identify a new color different from the current wave and background. If it exists, I draw a segment horizontally until it hits a boundary. If the row is uniform, I should propagate down at the endpoint of the segment. For example, in the given data with various rows, the first wave starts with a distinct 2, and I fill from there to the last column while checking for special colors in subsequent rows.**Verifying row counts**\n\nI want to double-check the number of rows for the test, which is supposed to be 7. Since my output has 7 rows, that seems to match perfectly. This gives me confidence that my answer is correct. I\u2019m feeling good about this consistency! It looks like I\u2019ve reached the confirmation I need. Everything checks out, and I can proceed with the conclusion.",
