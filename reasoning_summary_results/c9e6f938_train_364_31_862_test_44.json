For example, the input \"111\" becomes \"111111,\" essentially doubling the row. However, input like \"411\" results in \"411114.\" Here, I think I need to reverse the row \"411,\" which gives \"114,\" then append it to the original, creating \"411114.\" The same method applies to \"441,\" yielding \"441144.\" I'm exploring these transformations to understand the pattern better.**Understanding row transformations**\n\nIn the first example, I see that each input row is mirrored to create the output. For instance, \"111\" becomes \"111111,\" while \"411\" turns into \"411114\" by appending its reverse. This pattern continues for other rows, confirming that each output consists of the original row plus its horizontal reflection. \n\nIn the next examples, rows like \"50387\" become \"5038778305,\" and it consistently applies the same mirroring rule, leading to outputs like \"222222\" for input \"222.\" Each output then matches the row count, confirming the transformation.",
