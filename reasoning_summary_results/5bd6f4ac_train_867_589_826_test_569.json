It seems 5 is on the lower edge, but I wonder if a threshold of 5 or greater would work. They avoided digits like 0, 1, 2, and 6. Next, I\u2019m checking another input made up of 1, 4, 8, and 9 and noticed that there are no zeros in the rows. I\u2019m curious if the region they extracted maximizes something special and avoids zeros entirely.**Investigating color distribution**\n\nI'm analyzing a 3x3 grid to see if it exhibits a symmetric pattern. When looking at the selected region of rows 1-3 and columns 5-7, I see some symmetry along the vertical axis, but not horizontally. It raises a question about whether this arrangement corresponds to any number patterns, especially considering them choosing the rightmost columns across several examples. I think the general rule could be to extract the top three rows and the last three columns from any given input grid. For the test input with seven rows and nine columns, I\u2019ll extract those specific rows and columns accordingly.",
