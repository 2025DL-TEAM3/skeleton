For instance, in the first example, I see a 7 and 0 layout where certain block arrangements might define the shape I'm looking for. I notice symmetrical patterns and consider how the top-left 3 rows and leftmost columns influence the shape's design. Furthermore, noting where the zeros are in specific rows could be useful for generating output pixels later on.**Examining the grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a subgrid, specifically a 7x6 layout, and I notice some interesting patterns based on relative positions, particularly around zeros and ones. This looks like it might form the letter 'U'. When looking at the output, which is a 5x4 grid, I see how zeros align and confirm they match a shape similar to a rotated version of the larger grid. It seems that by cropping the outermost rows and columns from the input subgrid, I can achieve the output size. Let\u2019s see how it maps!**Calculating anomaly values**\n\nI\u2019m counting occurrences of anomalies\u2014specifically looking at '5' and '1' values in the grid. It looks like there are 4 '5's and 6 '1's. That tells me v1 is 5 and v2 is 1. I find their coordinates too, focusing on the ranges for rows and columns. My interior subgrid turns out to be 3x3, with the background represented by v0. I've mapped anomalies accordingly and filled the output grid based on my calculations. The final output is:\n\n252\n555\n255\n\nGreat, that seems to work!",
