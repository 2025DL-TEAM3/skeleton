The examples show that the first four rows remain the same, while the last four rows feature one variation. By splitting the grid into quadrants, we're essentially doubling the size both horizontally and vertically. So, for an input like 4444 with a variation in the last row, we\u2019ll replicate the pattern to create the expanded grid.**Expanding input grid**\n\nFor each cell in the input, I\u2019ll create a 2x2 block of the same value. So, essentially, I\u2019m scaling by a factor of two. Now, considering the first example with the grid provided, I note that only the cell at (3, 3) has a different value of 5. \n\nWhen I upscale this, the output should feature an 8x8 grid, with most areas filled with 4s, except for the last 2x2 block, which will contain the 5s. The odd cell helps determine which quadrant gets filled with that value!",
