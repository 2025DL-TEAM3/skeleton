Let's figure this out together!**Understanding grid transformations**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a grid transformation puzzle where I have an input grid and an output grid. The input seems to be a matrix with numbers arranged in rows, and the expected output is another matrix with different numbers. I\u2019m thinking the relationship could involve summing the values of neighboring cells or possibly some rotation or reflection. It's a bit tricky to see the exact mapping, but I'll dig deeper to find the connection!",
