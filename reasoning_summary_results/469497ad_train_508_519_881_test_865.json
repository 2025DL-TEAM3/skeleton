    "reasoning": "**Identifying transformation rules**\n\nI\u2019m tackling an ARC-like puzzle with three training examples to deduce the transformation rule for a new 5x3 input. The first example shows how a 4x4 input doubles to an 8x8 output, revealing a consistent pattern where both dimensions are multiplied by two. The transformation applies similarly to other examples, doubling the size while altering the numbers to create a new grid. I need to apply this logic to the new input based on observed patterns.**Exploring output rules**\n\nThe output grid size is twice that of the input grid, so for a new input of 5 rows and 3 columns, the output will be 10 rows and 6 columns. Each input cell seems to be replaced by a 2x2 block based on its value and neighbors, revealing more complex patterns than simple tiling. For the initial example, there's symmetry around the center, and I can see how the values are placed to form a coherent structured output. The mapping shows that each input row is doubled in the output, creating a visually symmetrical result.**Analyzing input patterns**\n\nIn the second example, the input grid consists of four rows. The output reflects a doubling of each row's content into eight rows. The first two rows of the output just repeat the first input row, while the next rows use the third input row but modify the center columns to indicate boundaries. It seems that the differences between adjacent rows mark specific cells with '2's to indicate a color change. I need to carefully map these relationships to understand the pattern and how the boundaries are defined.",
