I'm focusing on distinct colors to identify patterns, particularly looking for rows with something different from the background. However, all the rows contain numerous non-9 characters, making it challenging to pinpoint the specific pattern. \n\nI have a grid composed of 4 rows and 4 columns as follows:\n\n```\n1221\n9999\n1999\n1221\n```\n\nNow I need to examine each row to discover the intervals where non-9 characters represent repeated patterns.**Identifying Subgrid Patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing row patterns to find identical subgrids, particularly focusing on a shape that appears twice between rows 1-4 and 4-7. There are two horizontal shapes of height 4, which could suggest I need to find identical subgrids in the input. For example, rows 2 and 7 may match. \n\nI need to inspect the rows for potential matches and focus on segments that might display the pattern. I'm looking for a 4x4 shape that repeats. It appears the bounding shape correlates with a pattern in subsequent rows, so I should keep searching for matching segments.**Analyzing Bounding Regions**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the bounding regions of patterns in rows. For the identified patterns, I have rows with non-background elements at specific columns, aiming to find identical sprite instances. I realize that using intersections of non-background columns between rows is more effective than just utilizing unions.\n\nAlthough rows may contain varying non-background positions, I need to ensure I crop based on contiguous regions. This means defining bounding columns by the overlapping non-background sets. For rows 8 and 9, the intersection reveals that the cropping leads to selecting only column 5.**Determining Sprite Rows**\n\nI'm identifying identical rows in the dataset to find the sprite patterns. For rows 4 and 5, they are identical, so I\u2019ll crop rows 4 to 5 and columns 2 to 5, resulting in output:\n\n2332\n2332\n\nIn previous samples, patterns with too few non-background elements were excluded. I note that the best candidates typically must have at least two non-background positions. Therefore, while others might qualify, the intersection confirms rows 4 and 5 are unique duplicates, giving the output again of:\n\n2332\n2332\n\nThis seems plausible compared to previously suggested patterns, making it the final answer!",
