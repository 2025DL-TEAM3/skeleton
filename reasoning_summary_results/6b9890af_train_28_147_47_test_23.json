There are three tokens: two '4's located at (row 8, col 6) and one '7' at (row 10, col 7). The '4's seem to fill the interior positions, particularly in the range of (row 3, col 2-3). I need to ensure these are aligned properly. It seems the shape region is connected, so I\u2019ll also need to check the flags at the ends for labeling.**Examining training example**\n\nI should analyze training example one in detail. The input shows a grid with a background of 6 and a shape likely corresponding to background 1. In the grid, rows 1 and 2 are all 6's. Row 3 reveals 1's forming a shape. The shape appears to be a hollow rectangle made of 1's, bordered by 6's.\n\nThe tokens near the shape are mapped to specific interior positions. Based on the output dimensions, I can confirm the pattern matches and the inner region consists of values that replace the original positions while following the structure.**Mapping tokens for shapes**\n\nI need to explore how to map tokens to the shape. The tokens appear to be positioned at specific rows and columns relative to the shape. For example, in the scenario with the tokens at rows 8 and 10, it seems they cluster at certain locations beneath the shape.\n\nI\u2019m considering the offsets and whether the mapping might be rotated. It looks like the interior positions need to be filled with tokens in a consistent way, possibly adjusting for dimensional changes. I\u2019ll need to double-check the bounding boxes and regions to understand how these tokens fit into the overall arrangement accurately.",
