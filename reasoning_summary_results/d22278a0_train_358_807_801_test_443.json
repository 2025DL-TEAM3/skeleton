The second has 9 rows with 5 digits, and again, the output matches. The third one has 7 rows of 10 digits, and the output reflects that as well. For our test input, I see 4 lines of 8 characters. It seems I'll need to transform numbers based on adjacency or patterns, so I\u2019ll analyze the first example more closely.**Analyzing pattern in example 1**\n\nIn Example 1, I'm looking at the input and output grids for patterns. The input has rows mostly filled with \"9999\" and then \"7999\" at the end. The output changes certain digits, mostly to \"7777\" in an alternating pattern, appearing in rows 1, 3, 5, and part of row 7. \n\nIf I create a grid with 1s for positions changed to 7 and 0s for unchanged, I can plot coordinates to see an L-shape or diagonal formation. It's interesting how these patterns emerge!**Defining color patterns for grids**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a test input with 4 rows and 8 digits. The corners are defined as: top-left (1), top-right (3), bottom-left (3), and bottom-right (0). Based on these corner colors, I'm thinking of drawing a spiral or rectangle. \n\nStarting from the top-left corner, I\u2019ll alternate colors while filling in stripes. For quadrants, I\u2019ll focus on the L-shapes formed by the corner colors while keeping the center lines as background. I need to ensure each quadrant is filled according to its corner color, creating a clear pattern. This could simplify the output!",
