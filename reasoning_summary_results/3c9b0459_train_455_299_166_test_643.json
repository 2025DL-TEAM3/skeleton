I'm laying out the input and output grids clearly to compare them.\n\nAfter analyzing, it seems there might be a reflection involved. I wonder if the output is a result of transposing the input. The rows seem to reflect each other when reversed, confirming the relationship between the original and final grid configurations. This reversal aligns consistently within the structure I've checked!**Analyzing grid rotations**\n\nI\u2019m carefully checking the input and output rows to see if they represent a 180-degree rotation. First, I reverse each row and then reverse the order of the rows, which matches the expected output.\n\nMoving to the next example, I apply the same method and confirm the output aligns perfectly after the operation. The same process works with a third example, which verifies my conclusion. So, I've established the rule: rotating the grid by 180 degrees gives the correct output!**Completing the 180-degree rotation**\n\nI\u2019m trying to confirm that this puzzle consistently requires a 180-degree rotation. For the test input, I\u2019ll reverse the order of the rows and then reverse each one.\n\nStarting with the input grid, I see that reversing the last row indeed gives me \"9229999.\" Tracking the digits confirms my count, and I keep checking each row. Once I flip the entire grid, all output matches perfectly! So, the final output grid is established as 9229999, 7899271, 9999897, and 9999797. Everything checks out!",
