    "reasoning": "**Analyzing seed and filler rules**\n\nI\u2019ve found that row 4 has specific values, which leads to the identification of seeds at (0,0), (0,3), and (4,0). The output demonstrates digits 1 and 8 being used. Patterns show that seeds maintain their original digit while a lower digit is utilized as the filler, notably 8. In every example analyzed, the filler digit consistently remains 8, leading me to the conclusion that the rule is to fill based on parity and seed values.**Determining rectangle and filling rules**\n\nI think I need to find the smallest rectangle that includes the seeds and draw border lines of width 2 around it. For the first example, the seeds are adjacent, so the minimal bounding rectangle spans rows 0 to 5 and columns 0 to 6. I\u2019m considering dividing this rectangle into three equal bands and overlaying shapes. I noticed that the positions of the 8s can be connected with straight lines while leaving some zeros as seeds, which leads me to think about the filling strategy.**Reviewing filling rules and distances**\n\nI need to clarify the filling pattern for seeds along rows and columns. When filling between two seeds, the nearest adjacent positions should be excluded. For example, seeds at (0,0) and (0,6) would fill columns 2, 3, and 4, leaving columns 1 and 5 empty. Confusion arises with example 2, due to incorrect values in output rows. I wonder if they use a Manhattan distance approach, alternating between seed digits and fillers, and I\u2019ll need to adjust my understanding based on observed outputs.",
