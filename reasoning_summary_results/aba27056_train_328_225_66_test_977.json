    "reasoning": "**Solving the ARC-like Puzzle**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an ARC-like puzzle where the border shape changes color, with interior cells morphing to fill an area while maintaining the border form. The training examples show a consistent pattern, with the interior '1's being replaced by '4's. For instance, rows are structured so that when assessing the '1's bordering a filled area, they transform accordingly to create a new ring, defining the boundaries of the central region. I\u2019m figuring out how to generalize this transformation process.**Describing the Shape**\n\nI'm working on describing the shape based on the provided input. It appears that the shape consists of a hollow rectangle formed by '1's around a border of '5's, with a hollow center. The shape spans from the top left to the bottom right, with distinct '1's outlining the edges. Specifically, the borders consist of '1's primarily located at the leftmost and rightmost columns across multiple rows, while the middle section has a horizontal span of '1's. This creates a 'T' shape, mainly defined by the vertical and horizontal bulbs formed by these '1's!**Filling the Closed Shape**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to fill a closed outline shape based on the provided input grid, where the interior needs to be filled with color '4' while keeping the '7' borders intact. The grid consists of mostly '1's, establishing the background, with '7's creating a rectangular outline from rows 0 to 5 and columns 2 to 5. The interior area spans from rows 1 to 4 and columns 3 to 4. After the filling process, I\u2019ve confirmed the grid looks correct and maintains the required structure, so I\u2019m confident in providing the result.",
