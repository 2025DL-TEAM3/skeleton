    "reasoning": "**Deducing output patterns**\n\nI'm looking at the output from the provided grids and noting how different input sizes lead to varying output shapes. It's interesting that the output dimensions don't always correlate directly with the unique colors. For instance, a 5x5 grid results in a 2x5 output and a 9x7 in a 4x7. The output seems to highlight specific object positions, potentially linked to clusters or pairs of digits from the input. However, in the last example, the output was blank, suggesting we might need to rethink how the rules apply.**Exploring intersection points**\n\nIt seems like the markings in the output could indicate intersection points or distances between specific colored pixels in the input grids. The grid examples provided show different colored regions, like rows filled with 4's, 3's, or 7's. I wonder if the output is representing the sizes or transitions between these regions, where '2's mark key positions. Each row in the output may correspond to a segment from the input, reflecting the structure of those colored areas. In the third example, it seems to highlight shapes formed by different colors as well!**Analyzing color masks**\n\nI'm trying to identify how the outputs correspond to colored regions in the input grids. For example, in the earlier analysis, the outputs seemed to indicate the positions of '7's. The outputs may act as masks, isolating coordinates of certain colors, but I'm still unsure how to map those to the reduced output width.\n\nIn the second and third examples, it's possible that colors like 7 or 8 define unique shapes or structures. The challenge seems to lie in isolating the specific pixel arrangements that form distinct shapes. However, the analysis of outputs shows many zeros, which complicates understanding the criteria being used.**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing example three to understand how shapes of '7' and '1' are represented. The output width of 2 suggests it's capturing positions relative to a center line formed by '8's. It seems to mark the presence of '7' on the left and '1' on the right.\n\nI noticed discrepancies with multiple adjacent '7's. It looks like only the first non-zero value to the left of the center is marked. But in some cases, '7's along with their positions are inconsistently treated. I wonder if this is a part of a specific marking rule or approach to shape extraction.**Analyzing the shape extraction**\n\nI'm exploring the input shape, particularly how the vertical line of '7's is extracted. It seems like the bounding box is set to width 1, which is straightforward. However, I'm noticing inconsistencies when compared to other examples\u2014especially with irregular shapes. The intended rule looks to be about isolating the shape marked by '7' while ignoring others. \n\nSo I'm leaning towards generating a minimal bounding box for the '7's, resulting in a grid where the '2' marks its position, but I could also represent the full grid. Based on previous examples, it seems like an output of 4 rows by 7 columns would be more fitting.",
