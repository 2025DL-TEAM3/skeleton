The output appears to match the input\u2019s structure but shows counts of neighboring digits, possibly indicating colored blobs.\n\nFor instance, in the first row, I notice that the output for a zero in the input relates to nearby non-zero digits. I'm trying to clarify this relationship by analyzing the specific input and output pair. There\u2019s still more to uncover!**Examining Distances and Outputs**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the distance of the nearest 4 in the input grid, which is actually 6, but the output shows 4 instead. I'm wondering if this relates to Manhattan distances or perhaps counts of specific numbers in rows or columns. \n\nThe output might indicate directions to the nearest non-zero neighbor instead of exact distances. It seems like the colors from specific 'seed' values like 4 or 5 are propagating throughout the grid, and the number 2 could represent boundaries between different color zones. I\u2019ll keep gathering insights on how the zeros in both inputs and outputs appear!**Exploring Seed Influence and Outputs**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the regions around certain seeds in the input grid, particularly at row 4, column 2. The seeds are scattered throughout, with various distances to consider. The minimal distance is from a seed at row 2, column 1, but at the same time, I\u2019m seeing that the output is 0, which is puzzling. \n\nI wonder if the output values, like the digit 2, indicate boundaries, while a 0 signifies unreachable areas. The output reflects interactions among seeds, suggesting a method of propagation based on them, while I\u2019m also seeing overlaps and the role of distance in determining values. I\u2019ll keep unpacking this!**Analyzing Seed Distances**\n\nI'm focusing on the distances to the nearest seeds at row 4, column 2, where there are distances to both 4 and 5 seeds. I find a unique nearest seed, yet the output is puzzlingly zero. Then, I notice that zeros persist at certain symmetric positions in the output. \n\nThis leads me to think about how the output may represent boundaries, indicating areas with no seeds around them. It seems possible that a pattern is emerging based on surrounding influences, and I\u2019ll need to keep tracing these connections!",
