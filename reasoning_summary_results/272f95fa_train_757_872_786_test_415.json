    "reasoning": "**Examining the puzzle**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this puzzle, which has input and output grids of the same size filled with digits. It seems like there are some transformative patterns applied to the rows, columns, or cells. I wonder if these transformations relate to sequences of 9s changing into 2s, 4s, 6s, or 1s. Figuring out how these transformations work could be key to solving it. There\u2019s definitely a pattern to explore!**Analyzing the grid pattern**\n\nI'm tackling this example with two grids of digits. I see a pattern where rows 1, 3, and 5 contain 9s surrounding a column of 5s at positions 5 and 9. If I index columns from 1 to 10, the pattern emerges: columns 1-4 and 6-8 are filled with 9s, while column 5 is a 5. In the output, there are changes in specific columns of the first, third, and fifth rows to different numbers that may represent their distance from a center point or pattern. There\u2019s definitely more to explore here!**Exploring grid patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid arrangement with repeating blocks of 9s surrounding 5s. It looks like the central element is 5, with two columns of 5s dividing blocks of 9s. Rows 1, 3, and 5 showcase different configurations of these blocks, which may correspond to components labeled by size. I\u2019m curious if the changes in the 9s represent their distance from the center 5s. Each row seems to have connected components, and I'm noticing how the shifts happen based on neighboring 5s. There's a lot to dig into here!",
