    "reasoning": "**Calculating distances and outputs**\n\nI'm exploring how to compute distances for each cell from points P1 and P2. I think I'm using the Manhattan distance formula, which is |r-4|+|c-3| for D1 and |r-7|+|c-3| for D2. When testing cells, I find that at (3,2) and (3,3), output values are 5 and 1, respectively, depending on proximity to P1 or P2. Oops, it appears the outputs aren't preserving special pixels\u2014I need to check that further.**Analyzing distance outputs**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how the distances from points P1 and P2 convert into values like 1 and 2, possibly using Manhattan distances. I wonder if I should consider the sum of distances modulo something. Testing at (4,3), it looks like the output is 2 rather than what I expected. The patterns reveal alternating values that seem to mimic a diamond shape, with rows having similar outputs. It feels complex, but maybe I need to draw around sources and analyze how these wavefronts interact to simplify the pattern interpretation.**Implementing diamond patterns**\n\nI'm working on a grid output based on special cells, where the background color remains unchanged except for specific cells and their neighborhoods. I've established a rule for how to set colors: special cells will keep their original color, while their cardinal neighbors will be assigned a new value, presumably 1. Diagonal neighbors will have the special cell's original color. I\u2019ll test this with input examples to ensure the pattern holds true and confirm overlaps don\u2019t occur between different special cells. Let\u2019s apply this to a sample 7x7 grid and output the results!**Compiling output grid**\n\nI'm organizing the output grid and checking the values for each row based on the special cells. For row 1, I've established it as \"8841488.\" When moving to row 2, I observe that the values change around the special cell, leading to \"8818188.\" Row 3 holds the same structure as row 1, while rows 4 and 5 remain as \"8888888.\" In rows 6 and 7, I see a similar pattern, giving me the complete output. I've confirmed that the grid's dimensions are correct and that the pattern is symmetric.",
