For the first example, it starts with five two-digit numbers. The output gathers these numbers in reverse before appending the original sequence at the end. The second example shows five rows of five digits, and I need to figure out if the output also follows a reverse pattern. It seems that each input is mirrored in the output order. I\u2019ll continue breaking this down!**Clarifying Output Generation**\n\nI'm working through input rows like these: \n\n```\n22222\n22222\n42422\n42222\n22222\n```\n\nReversing them gives me the first part of the output, followed by the original order. So for any given N input rows, my output will consist of 2N total rows. For instance, an input like:\n\n```\n3222\n3333\n3233\n3323\n3333\n```\n\nwill yield output rows reversed first, then repeated in their original order. Thus, the final output matches that structure perfectly, reflecting the expected mirroring along the horizontal axis, ensuring no mistakes along the way!",
