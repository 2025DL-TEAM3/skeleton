    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at some data regarding a grid structure. The pattern seems composed of repeating motifs across two rows, punctuated by a separator row, making up a height of three blocks. There's a clear structure with groups of rows, where the first duplicate in each pair is modified, while the second remains unchanged. It's interesting to see how these modifications characterize the repeating elements of the grid. I\u2019ll keep this framework in mind for any further analysis on the pattern.**Understanding transformations in patterns**\n\nIt looks like in each repeating section, there's a transformation of the first row by copying part of another row. The changes involve adjusting non-constant digits to match the original. In the examples provided, row patterns reveal that certain rows are duplicates. For instance, in the second example, row 4 has been replaced with row 1, while row 5 remains unchanged. The goal is to establish a symmetric pattern that repeats consistently through groups, making sure each starts with row A, followed by B and C.**Exploring pattern propagation**\n\nI\u2019m diving into how columns and rows interact in the given grid. It seems like column 3 sometimes changes to match column 1, but there are exceptions, particularly in row 5. The non-zero rows could represent colored endpoints that we need to connect in a way that forms consistent vertical lines. Each shape's endpoints should connect and propagate downward, and while the last row remains unchanged, the intermediate rows adjust to match those endpoints. It appears I might be onto a rule involving alternating patterns in sequences.",
