    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit counts**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to identify rows with an odd count of the digit '3' or '0'. I noticed the center appears to form a plus shape around (4,4) and that row 7 is significant, being the 7th of 8. Checking the digit '9', I found row 7 has none, while row 4 has one. Counting the '3s' in each row, I've noted row 1 has six, row 3 has six, and row 5 has seven. Row 7 isn't unique either, as it has five '3s' and one '0'.**Examining zero patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the rows and noticing that only row 7 has a zero, which leads me to think that if a row has a zero, the output should be all ones (like 11111111). This is interesting because it also has '1' at both ends. For rows without zeros, the output is mostly threes with a \u20181\u2019 positioned based on where the zero was found. In row 7, the unique zero is at position 4, which may define this pattern distinctly compared to others.**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI'm exploring the shapes of different output patterns based on the input grids. In grid A, I see that most rows have a pattern of '33333133', except for row 7, which is all ones (11111111) because it contains a zero. This is highlighting a cross shape. However, it\u2019s confusing why they use column 5 instead of 4 for marking ones. In grid B, there are multiple zeros, so I wonder about a different shape. For grid C, it looks like the output uses rows based on whether they hold certain values. I think the choice of '9's and '1's as maximum and minimum values gives some insight into the patterns.**Final output grid construction**\n\nI'm thinking about using '2' as the cross with a background of '8'. That leads me to create the final output grid like this:\n\n```\n82882828\n82882828\n82882828\n22222222\n82882828\n22222222\n82882828\n22222222\n82882828\n```\n\nThat's the pattern I'll go with, even though I'm feeling a bit uncertain about it. Still, it seems like a clear display of the intended design.",
