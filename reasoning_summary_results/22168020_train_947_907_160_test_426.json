    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle patterns**\n\nI'm working on an ARC puzzle that involves pattern transformations. I've noticed three training pairs with different dimensions. The first training input has 8 rows and 9 columns, and the second one has 9 rows and 9 columns. The inputs vary in dimensions, which is important for analysis. The test input is 8 rows and 8 columns, and I need to identify the transformation rules based on the training examples. It seems like I might need to look for highlighted cells or recoloring patterns.**Exploring pattern transformations**\n\nIn this example, I'm analyzing a puzzle where certain digits are transformed based on their positions. The outputs replace specific digits near larger ones, like changing 3s to 1s or 7s. The second example seems to involve 6s, 0s, 2s, and 4s where some 6s are switched to 0s. In the third example, 5s are being replaced with 8s in specific rows, indicating a systematic change around those central shapes. It looks like the outputs conduct specific transformations based on adjacent colored items.**Applying color transformation rules**\n\nI\u2019ve figured out a rule for transforming colors: if a color appears exactly twice in a row, I fill the spaces in between with that color. However, if the two occurrences are adjacent, like in some cases where the digits are beside each other, I don\u2019t make any changes.\n\nSo for my test input, since the only color that meets the requirement is '4', and it appears adjacent in two rows, the output remains unchanged from the input. Therefore, the grid will look the same as before.",
