    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nI'm examining how numbers transform in a grid. It seems like 1s remain in the same spots they started, and zeros change to either 1 or 2 throughout the grid. However, zeros that are adjacent to 1s or 8s stay preserved or change too, while others around them transform. So, I'm considering this as a sort of contiguous region that fills from the 1s, perhaps forming shapes. I wonder how to find distances from the new zeros to the nearest non-zero.**Examining distance assignment**\n\nI'm pondering whether the digit assigned corresponds to the Manhattan distance parity. For example, at cell (0,0), the nearest original is at (0,3), which has a distance of 3. Since it's odd, could it assign a value of 1? But the output is 2. It\u2019s confusing! I need to check further distances like to (1,4) and others to determine the nearest original for (0,1). I notice adjustments in the input-output relationships, especially with how certain numbers seem preserved, like 3s and 9s.**Understanding digit mapping**\n\nI'm investigating how digits are mapped between the original input and outputs. It seems that in several examples, certain digits are consistently removed and replaced with a new color, likely the smallest missing positive integer. For instance, in one case, the zeros are being replaced not only by new digits but also influenced by neighboring original labels. It looks like they create distinct zones based on proximity to those labels, possibly assigning 1 or 2 depending on whether they\u2019re closer to certain original values. However, there are inconsistencies in the outputs that I need to explore further.**Exploring fill color usage**\n\nI\u2019m delving into why example 1 uses two fill colors, unlike examples 2 and 3. It appears that example 1 has seeds of types 1 and 8, while others each have just two types like 3 and 9 in example 2. The way fills are applied may depend on shape adjacency. In example 1, the frequency of seed types plays a role, but ultimately, it looks like I should simplify focus on examples 2 and 3, suggesting that the fill color should be based on the smallest missing digit when replacing 1s with 2s.",
