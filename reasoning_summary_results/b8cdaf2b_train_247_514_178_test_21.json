    "reasoning": "**Analyzing column data**\n\nI've got shapes with indices showing 9000 in rows 1, 2, and 3, followed by 3900 in rows 4 and 5, and then 9000 again in row 6. The outputs show 3's moving from row 4-5 to fill in rows 2, 3, and 6. It seems that the 3's also create a pathway, likely connecting colored cells. Eventually, I notice the arrangement is about forming connections. So, color3 might signify a path in this context.**Understanding color transformation**\n\nIt looks like the goal is to connect all original 3's to create a path. The original 3's are located at row 4, column 1 and row 5, column 1, forming a vertical alignment. In the output, additional 3's appear at (2,4), (3,3), and (6,3), creating a symmetrical \"V\" shape. \n\nNow looking at the second input example, it seems they've replaced specific values with zeros in the first row while keeping others unchanged. Only two zeros were added in that transformation, suggesting a unique pattern of insertion.**Examining arm extensions**\n\nI'm analyzing how the arms extend from their original cells. Starting from (2,1) seems to require a diagonal up-right, which leads to (1,3), but it actually goes to (1,3) after two steps. The pattern follows a two-phase extension \u2014 first jumping a larger distance, then adjusting gradually with smaller steps. The same applies to the lower arm, taking two steps and then inching closer. The general rule for vertical segments is to extend arms symmetrically upward and downward until hitting an edge or background cell, ensuring a consistent diagonal shape.**Analyzing arm placements**\n\nI\u2019m understanding how the arms extend from their original points. For example, the upper arm from (4,1) moves diagonally to (3,3) and then up to (2,4). The first jump covers two columns, and subsequent steps increase by one column. This suggests a pattern where the first step is larger to connect arms symmetrically, creating a V-shape. The algorithm needs to place color cells until a boundary is reached. For example, if the vertical segment's length is 1, both arms go outward, showing symmetry. I\u2019m analyzing how the horizontal and vertical movements relate to boundary conditions.**Evaluating segment orientation**\n\nThe algorithm might favor picking color segments based on length and orientation. For instance, it's considering horizontal segments of color 7, which appear more frequently. If a segment is horizontal, it could draw arms upwards at angles, but I'm unsure if it can extend both upwards and downwards. The task seems to focus on forming a shape from the color segments, particularly aiming for a V shape. It's essential to clarify segment placements and ensure consistent algorithm logic throughout the examples, especially regarding expected output transformations.**Determining arm placements**\n\nTo create diagonal arms from a horizontal segment, I need to ensure both upward and downward directions are correctly represented. For a segment at row 10, columns 3-4, I\u2019ll focus only on the upward direction since downward leads off-grid. I\u2019ll establish arm positions based on their endpoints, placing new values at calculated coordinates. The process involves skipping initial cells based on previous examples to ensure placements fit the grid constraints. The final output retains existing values while adding new ones strategically at valid positions. This approach appears reasonable.",
