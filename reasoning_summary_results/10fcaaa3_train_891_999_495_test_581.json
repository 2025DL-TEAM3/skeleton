    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle mapping**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle where small grids of numbers lead to larger grids. The first example shows a 3x4 input grid of 2222, creating a 6x8 output by doubling dimensions. The second example involves a 3x3 input that transforms into a 6x6 output. Each cell seems to become a 2x2 block, but there's a pattern that incorporates colors based on values. I'll need to keep track of input coordinates (i,j) to understand the mapping better.**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI'm figuring out how the output grid works, with the idea that each input cell creates a 2x2 block. When an input cell has an uncommon value like 4 in the first example, the pattern shifts. In my analysis, I notice the output structure for example one, with the row index for the unusual value leading to an interesting arrangement in the larger output grid. It seems crucial to map input positions correctly to understand how they affect the output patterns, especially with values 2 and 4.**Clarifying output patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a pattern in the grid transformation where special cells dictate specific outputs. For certain inputs, I suspect that all cells besides the special one can take on a distinct value, such as 8, forming a cross. This pattern carries over into the output as a more extensive grid where these special cells are represented in multiple ways. By breaking the output into quadrants, I see distinct repeating structures that either match or differ between them, leading to two defined patterns. It's critical to track the positions meticulously!**Finalizing output structure**\n\nI notice that in cases without a special value, 8s are inserted in all other cases to maintain the pattern. If there's no special value to reference, I think the output should simply reflect that. Based on this reasoning, the final output looks like this: \n\n66666666  \n66166616  \n66666666  \n66666666  \n66166616  \n66666666  \n\nI believe this covers all the necessary details. I'm ready to proceed with this!",
