    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit transformation**\n\nI'm noticing a problem where we have input strings of digits and their corresponding outputs, which seem to show iterative \"moves\" transforming the input until reaching a stable state. For example, with the input \"333337,\" the output steps down to \"333333\" over several rows. \n\nThis indicates that certain digits are changing based on their positions. In the second example, the digits decrease from \"6666666669\" to several rows of \"6666666666\" after replacing the last digit. It looks like I'm recognizing a pattern of repetitive transformations here!**Examining digit patterns**\n\nI've noticed that for the input of length 10, the number of output rows seems related to the difference between the last digit and a number, but it's not consistent. Looking at an example input of \"2222222868,\" it starts as \"2222222868\" and transforms step-wise to \"2222222222.\" \n\nThe digits change through a kind of shifting process, where the original 8 at position 8 gets replaced, and then other digits rotate. The rows reflect this adjustment, though I\u2019m still sorting out the exact mechanics!**Understanding digit transformations**\n\nI see a pattern in how the digits transform across the rows. For instance, in a row, the digits shift right when they exceed the minimum, replacing those positions with the smallest digit. In examples like \"333337,\" the '7' is replaced by '3', whereas in \"2222222868,\" the trailing digits shift right, bringing in '2' to replace the larger numbers until they stabilize. \n\nSo, in essence, each step replaces the rightmost non-\u2018D\u2019 digits with \u2018D\u2019 while pushing the others to the right, explaining why certain numbers disappear or transform!**Detailing digit transformations further**\n\nLet's break down how the input transforms. For an input like \"22222233,\" I identify the prefix count of the first identical digit, which is '2' appearing six times, leaving '3' as the remaining segment. \n\nAs I build the rows, I notice that with each transformation, the prefix length increases until it matches the total length, and the remaining non-'D' digits shift left. Consequently, I produce stable rows that ultimately yield the same repeated output. The final result, for this example, is indeed:\n\n22222233  \n22222223  \n22222222  \n22222222",
