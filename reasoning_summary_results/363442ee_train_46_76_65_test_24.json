    "reasoning": "**Analyzing a grid pattern**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that the only non-uniform block is the top-left 3x3 grid. Row 3 stands out with repeating digits. It looks like they\u2019re replicating that 3x3 block into the rows below and to the right, specifically copying it to rows 4-6, columns 0-2. The values match perfectly, and checking rows 7-9 confirms the same pattern. Rows 4-6 in columns 6-8 feature all 5s, so no clones are there. It seems there are three distinct positions for the original block.**Checking copied grid positions**\n\nIt seems they didn't copy the block to (4,6) since that overlaps with the first copy. In row 4, columns 0-2 show 101 while columns 3-8 are all 5s, confirming only the block at (4,0) was copied, not the one at (4,6). They copied the block three times: to positions (4,0)-(6,2), (7,0)-(9,2), and (7,6)-(9,8). These correspond to blank sub-grids that are uniform, possibly indicating they fill empty regions with the pattern. I need to identify those blank areas for proper filling!**Investigating grid fill patterns**\n\nIt looks like only the blanks of size 3x3 are filled, particularly in areas where the surrounding anchor color matches. In the second example, the barrier at row 3 prevents filling above it. I see regions filled below, but two regions (rows 4-6, cols 3-5 and 6-8) remain untouched. I wonder if they follow a rule to propagate the filled blocks away from the source only into contiguous blank areas. The idea of filling two positions as separate tiled blocks is intriguing. I need to look into that further!**Finalizing the output grid**\n\nI've compiled the full output grid, which shows the structure clearly. It consists of ten rows, detailing the values as follows:\n\nRow0: 4444744447  \nRow1: 4206642066  \nRow2: 4722047220  \nRow3: 4444799999  \nRow4: 4206692999  \nRow5: 4722099999  \nRow6: 1111111111  \nRow7: 9999944447  \nRow8: 9999942066  \nRow9: 9999947220  \n\nI compared this output with example three and confirmed the consistency of the mappings and backgrounds. Everything looks aligned!",
