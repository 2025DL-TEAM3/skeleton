    "reasoning": "**Analyzing matrix values**\n\nI'm working through a matrix and examining the values in specific rows and columns. In row 2, most entries are 7, but the last column is 4, forming a 2x6 matrix. When I mirror it horizontally, I get matching outputs. \n\nContinuing with another example, I'm looking at a grid with mostly 4s, identifying non-background values. I need to examine the relevant regions and see how they align. This will lead to the final outcomes, which seem promising!**Determining output rows**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing rows of numbers to identify non-background elements. Rows 1 and 2 hold critical values. Specifically, rows 1 and 2 have values of 0 and 6 in the relevant columns. \n\nAfter mirroring the rows horizontally, I determine the output is \"00\" and \"06.\" I need to ensure I follow the previously established order from the examples. It seems I\u2019ll keep these rows as-is without additional formatting, leading to the final answer:\n\n00  \n06",
