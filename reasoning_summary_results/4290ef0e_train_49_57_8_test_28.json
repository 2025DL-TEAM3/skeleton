    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at examples of grids with varying shapes and sizes, focusing on the first input with 9 rows of 10 digits each. Then, I see the second input also has 10 rows, all measuring 10 digits. Notably, example one is 10x9, the second is 9x10, and the third is 10x10. I\u2019m realizing I need to find a central region or detect overlaps. Ultimately, the goal is to produce a 5x5 mosaic representing these patterns.**Identifying pattern boundaries**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a 5x5 output pattern from an input that originally has 10 rows and 9 columns. The focus is on a specific region where 2s and 0s appear amongst 7s. I need to mark which rows and columns contain these numbers and recognize that the main area of interest spans from rows 2 to 6 and columns 2 to 6. After further consideration, there are clusters of zeros and 2s forming a symmetrical pattern that I need to align with the input's region for clarity.**Exploring pixel mapping**\n\nIn rows 3 to 6, I see patterns of 7s, 0s, and 2s forming a subgrid that seems to have layers with the outermost being 7s and edges with 2s. The transformation into a 5x5 output seems like a complement where 7 becomes 2 and inner zeros remain zeros. Though it's a bit tricky, I suspect that the output retains a shape representation while potentially downsampling the input. The idea of mapping input blocks to a smaller output block helps clarify how colors transform through this process.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI\u2019ve identified a distinct 3x3 pattern with a ring of 5s, and I\u2019m scanning for the rest. I confirm the colors present in the input: 0, 4, and 5, leading to C being 4 for the border and B as 0 for the center. I start constructing a 5x5 grid where the edges get the border color (C=4), the inner ring gets the ring color (A=5), and the center gets B=0. The output neatly represents the expected color structure.",
