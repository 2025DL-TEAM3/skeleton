    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the ARC puzzle**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this ARC puzzle involving squares of numbers, trying to understand how the transformation works. Given the examples, I need to uncover the underlying rule. The first example shows that certain rows are identical, while one row shifts the numbers. Specifically, the input row has a block of 2s that seems to shift to the left in the output. I notice that three 2s move to different column positions, so I\u2019ll explore this pattern further to see if I can find any additional rules.**Examining the number shift**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the movement of numbers in the ARC puzzle, particularly how the input shows a diagonal pattern of 2s. Each row appears to shift the numbers to the right, but those at the boundaries can\u2019t move. For example, in row 4, 2s move from columns 3 to 4, while other numbers adjust accordingly. However, in row 7, the input remains unchanged because the 2s are at the boundary. I'll need to consider how these shifts create the overall pattern!**Understanding the X shape movement**\n\nI\u2019m puzzling over why the shape doesn\u2019t seem to move in some rows. For example, in row 5 of the second example, only one of the 2s shifts while the other stays in place, which matches the observed pattern. It seems like the shape is a skewed X, so I\u2019m thinking the left half moves horizontally to the right, while the right arm remains static. I wonder if we can identify a consistent rule for how the 2s slide, perhaps keeping the bottom row anchored while shifting the others. There\u2019s definitely a complex interaction at play!",
