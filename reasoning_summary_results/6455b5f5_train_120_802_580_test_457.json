    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation rules**\n\nI'm working on an ARC puzzle involving transformation rules where I have to figure out how specific input grids change into outputs. I noticed that rows with all 9s remain unchanged, while others either stay the same or show transformations. For instance, in one row, certain digits are replaced with 8s, while in others, all 6s are transformed to 1s. There\u2019s a pattern here that I need to clarify, particularly why some rows seem to have inconsistent transformations.**Examining transformation patterns**\n\nI'm diving into why certain rows are unchanged while others have transformed. It seems rows like 1 and 2 share similar patterns with row 4 but didn\u2019t change. Maybe it\u2019s based on groupings or patterns within 2x2 blocks? The rows that changed appear to be the ones immediately below all-9 rows. So, transformations might occur in rows directly beneath full-9 rows. In looking at a new example, I see different patterns without all-9 rows, so I need to analyze those changes further.**Mapping patterns and changes**\n\nI'm analyzing a pattern where the background color below the first anchor changes to 8, while subsequent anchors turn background elements to 1. In this test, with only one anchor (row 3), I need to apply this mapping to the rows below. So, for rows 4 and 5, I\u2019ll transform 0s to 8s while keeping 2s unchanged. However, I see some complexities with previous examples concerning which numbers change and the rules for each row. For now, I\u2019ll stick with my understanding to produce the final output.",
