    "reasoning": "**Mapping shapes in grid**\n\nI'm examining a grid with a 4x8 structure, looking to map colors based on the input values. The input has clusters of 5s that I need to identify and classify. \n\nUpon analysis, I find two clusters: Cluster A on the right with columns 6 and 7 consistently showing 5 across all rows, and Cluster B that forms a shape on the left. For the output, the 5s in the right columns will remain unchanged while I mark the shapes appropriately.**Analyzing shape transformations**\n\nAlright, I've updated row 1 to show 2s where appropriate, while keeping the 5s on the right intact. Now, for the new 9-row, 7-column input, I'm identifying a shape based on the presence of 1s, which creates a 'C' pattern. \n\nI've pinpointed the positions of the 1s, marking their connections and borders. This closed loop shape forms with vertical paths at certain columns. It\u2019s interesting to note those gaps in the structure and how the 1s form these lines as I visualize the shape!**Mapping spiral shapes**\n\nI'm identifying specific positions of 1s to define shapes in my grid. The spiral pattern starts from row 2, column 1, looping down and around. The interior of the spiral will be filled with 2s.\n\nNow for the cluster of 5s in the second example, there are distinct left and right clusters. I need to analyze how these connect, and I think the left cluster resembles an 'S' shape. In my output, the 5s in the left shape are replaced by 2s while the rest of the background remains unchanged, clearly showing the intended transformation.**Finalizing the output grid**\n\nI\u2019ve processed the input grid and changed specific 9s to 2s based on their positions. For example, row 0 changed from 9s to 2s at columns 0 and 3, while other rows adjusted similarly. Rows with all 9s remain unchanged.\n\nThis leads to the final output showing the transformed grid without interior holes, maintaining consistency with expectations. The resulting grid is:\n\n2002  \n0222  \n0020  \n0002  \n9999  \n9999  \n\nI feel confident this aligns with the expected output!",
