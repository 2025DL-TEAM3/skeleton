Each example shows a shared pattern. \n\nFor instance, in the first task, I notice the grid has rows primarily filled with 4's, creating a ring-like border. Rows 0-2 repeat in rows 7 and 8, reinforcing this border observation. Let\u2019s explore the transformation in greater detail!**Exploring grid transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid pattern involving 3's, 4's, and zeros. The second example has an 8's border mixed with 6's, 8's, and 3's, while the third presents a 1's shape. In the first example, the notable difference in row 4 shows how zeros are moving to the edges. \n\nIn row 4 of the input, zeros at columns 4 and 5 shift to the first and last columns in the output. It seems that the transformation involves relocating zeros towards the borders. I'll keep investigating the other rows.**Identifying grid movement patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid puzzle where zeros move symmetrically to the edges. In the second example, I see how two '3's in row 4 shift to columns 0 and 9 in the output. Meanwhile, the zeros from row 5 also move to the leftmost column. The transformation seems consistent: target digits are located in a central shape and moved outward to the nearest border, preserving their order.\n\nIn the third example, the inner color '4' also shifts vertically to the top row. It seems the movement preserves column positions while going to the edges. I'll keep exploring these patterns!**Analyzing grid shapes and movements**\n\nI seem to be figuring out that the '9's form a closed loop around an interior area, which I\u2019m describing as a \"donut\" shape. The '4's are situated within this hole, and I realize they should move to the nearest border. However, they seem to jump to the outermost layer of '1's instead of staying within the '9' loop. The goal might be to mirror the interior shapes to the borders.\n\nIn the second example, I see that the zeros are transformed in a similar way, moving while retaining their patterns. I need to refine the rules for shifting these shapes based on their orientations!",
