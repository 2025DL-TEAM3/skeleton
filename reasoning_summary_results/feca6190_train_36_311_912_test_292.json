The idea seems to be converting the number to a string, padding it with zeros, and then rotating the digits to create multiple outputs.\n\nFor instance, with the input 8001, it gets padded to \"00008001\". The shifting looks like it starts by cycling the digits, producing a total of eight outputs. The first includes zero padding before the digits; this seems key to the logic.**Analyzing digit placement**\n\nI\u2019m thinking of splitting the number into individual digits and placing them in an 8-digit wide grid. I want to create eight outputs for the digit 8001. Each output will be eight digits in length.\n\nThen, I\u2019ll check for the substring \"8001\" in them. For example, in the fourth output, \"00008001\" matches perfectly. The fifth output contains that sequence rotated. I envision starting with an eight-digit vector based on the input digits shifted about, leading to these sequential outputs. It's confirming an initial rotation logic that aligns with each output.",
