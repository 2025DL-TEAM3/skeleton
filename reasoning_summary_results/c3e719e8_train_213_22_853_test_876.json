    "reasoning": "**Determining multiplication factors**\n\nI'm analyzing the relationship between input and output dimensions. For the first example, 3x2 leads to 9x4, showing that rows multiplied by 3, while columns doubled. The factors seem consistent for both inputs. Looking at the third case, it suggests that the factor for rows might depend on the input, but columns appear to consistently double. \n\nIn summary, for input R x C, the output seems to generally be R*R for rows and C*C for columns, with C being consistently 2, resulting in 4.**Analyzing grid structure**\n\nI'm exploring the relationship between input dimensions and the output grid. For rows, it seems I should use R squared, leading to outputs like 9x4 or 4x4. Each input cell corresponds to a block size based on the input values. \n\nHowever, I noticed a mismatch in the output when constructing rows from the input grid. The rows repeat patterns rather than fill uniformly, which complicates the block height. The 3x2 structure seems to extend vertically, potentially leading to the observed discrepancies. I'm working on clarifying how to represent the outputs accurately.**Exploring output pattern**\n\nI'm analyzing the output structure for the input provided. It appears there are three distinct horizontal stripes across the data. \n\nFor the first stripe, I see that each number from the input repeats itself, forming patterns like 1111, 3838, and 1515. The second stripe consists of zeros, perhaps indicating the absence of additional numbers. The last stripe combines the input numbers with '00', resulting in blocks like 1100, 3800, and 1500. \n\nOverall, it looks like I'm creating a 3x3 grid of combinations from the inputs, where the grid's layout corresponds to input pairings and concatenations.**Constructing output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing the input grid and noting where the values are. In this case, I identify a pivot value and create a transformation based on that. The output grid is structured using blocks, where each block contains the original input matrix if it matches the pivot and zeros otherwise.\n\nFor the given input values, the pivot is 8, and I end up with a 9x4 grid where only the first tile contains actual data from the input, while the rest are zeros. The final output displays each row clearly, ensuring consistency in the format.",
