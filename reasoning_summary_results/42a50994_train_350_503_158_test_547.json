    "reasoning": "**Solving an ARC Puzzle**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle where we have input and output pairs of numbers. It seems like the task involves modifying rows based on the predominant digit. For instance, comparing the first two rows reveals that the leading digit changes from 3 to 5 in the second row. I notice that rows with only one digit different from the majority get adjusted. Overall, I'm trying to determine which specific positions change while leaving the remaining digits intact. Let's dig deeper!**Analyzing Row Changes**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how the rows change based on non-5 digits. In Row 3, 3 changes to 5, while in Row 4, the last 4 becomes 5. Row 5 remains unchanged since there are two non-5s. Row 6 sees 4 change to 5, but Row 7 also changes 2 to 5. Interestingly, Row 2 changes only the first 3, leaving the last unchanged. It seems the rule is to update the rightmost non-5 when two non-5s exist, but Row 2 changes the leftmost instead. It\u2019s a bit confusing!**Refining the Non-5 Rules**\n\nI'm examining rules about changing non-5 digits based on their positions. It seems the adjustments happen only if non-5s aren't in the last position. For instance, in Row 4 with two non-5s, they still made a change, which contradicts the original rule. I suspect they focus on increasing the contiguous block of 5s. This would mean they change the non-5 that helps extend the longest block. It\u2019s fascinating to see how they manage these sequences!",
