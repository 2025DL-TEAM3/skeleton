    "reasoning": "**Analyzing symmetry and patterns**\n\nI\u2019m observing that elements are symmetric around the center, with zeros preserved between specific columns. Fives were moved inward to positions that maintain this symmetry. It's interesting to consider if non-dominant colors also shift toward the center or compress.\n\nIn comparing the input and output data, it seems the output is a rotated version of the input. Some rows remain unchanged while others have altered values. For instance, '9' shifted from one column to another within the rotations.**Analyzing movement of elements**\n\nIt seems like the '9' from row0 moved to row4, but there are two '9's to account for. I found locations of '9's at (0,3) and (9,2). In the output, they ended up at row4 column3 and row5 column2. This suggests they moved inward towards the center of the grid, considering the grid's center is between rows 4 and 5.\n\nThe general idea appears to be identifying cells with the least frequent colors and repositioning them towards the center while keeping their relative positions. In the new input grid, I can see similar movement patterns continuing!**Examining outlier movements**\n\nI'm analyzing the movements of '3's in a grid with '1's, '2's, and '3's. I found '3's in positions (0,3) and (9,2), which are then repositioned to (4,2) and (5,3) in the output, around the center. This suggests a pattern where outlier values, like the largest, are moved toward the center. \n\nI noticed how this applies in the first training where '5's kept similar row parity, with both staying in the same row in the output, confirming a rule to maintain their relative positions based on orientation.",
