    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit patterns**\n\nI'm considering if the task involves counting occurrences of certain digits or identifying specific patterns. The first input only presents the digits 8 and 6, even though 5 appears in the grid. Could the 5's act as a background or filler? Looking closely at the grid, there seems to be a distinct pattern where rows alternate between sequences of 8's and 6's. The 8's possibly form a small shape, which might represent a 2x2 output in some way.**Reconstructing the grid example**\n\nI'm looking at a 6x10 grid, examining the arrangement of numbers. The 5's seem to function as a mask, while the 8's create two distinct rectangles. Their coordinates appear to form two 2x2 squares at (0,0) and (3,0), meaning I have separated squares located at the top-left and top-right. The resulting output is a 2x2 block capturing the neighborhood of 8's. It\u2019s interesting that the output size is smaller, suggesting a relation to unique shapes. Now, I\u2019m curious about the second example and how it maps.**Mapping the mask clusters**\n\nI'm analyzing the coordinates of the mask clusters, identifying a shape pattern resembling a plus sign centered at (2,3). The pixels (0,1) and (0,5) are edges of the mask, which stretches from columns 2 to 4. Notably, there are two distinct mask clusters, one from rows 1-3 and another from rows 5-7. I\u2019m hypothesizing that these form a 3x3 square with hidden corners. By merging the clusters, I can reconstruct the complete shape from the visible pixels, revealing the full 3x3 pattern.**Unifying shape mapping**\n\nI'm mapping the input to shape, identifying the primary columns for shape. Each shape cell gets filled with 8 if it matches mask colors or has adjacent relevant pixels, otherwise it gets the background color of 5. As I process each row, I check conditions and note down the shape: Row0 has 8s at (0,0) and (0,2), and Row1 has all 8s, leading to a pattern that looks symmetric. The resultant grid appears to reflect the expected shape, and checks against mask positions confirm the accuracy. The final output grid nicely aligns with the pattern found in the examples.",
