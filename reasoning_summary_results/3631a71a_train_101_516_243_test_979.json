    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformation**\n\nI'm evaluating a puzzle involving a 10x10 grid, trying to infer the transformation from the input to the output grids. From my observations, it seems like there are reflective symmetries along the main diagonal, particularly after looking closely at the first example.\n\nRows 1 and 2 appear unchanged, while row 3 shows a subtle change. The biggest transformation happens in row 5, indicating a possible mirroring effect around the center of the grid. This suggests a pattern where some subgrid elements are repositioned in a mirrored fashion.**Identifying transformation patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the outputs and noticing some patterns. For instance, the output of row 10 matches output row 3, which raises questions about their similarities. It looks like there's symmetry at play since rows 5 to 8 appear to mirror each other.\n\nTo break it down, rows 1 and 2 remain unchanged from the input, while rows 3 and 10 display modifications. The transformation seems to involve recognizing patterns or shapes within the matrix, potentially involving rotations of certain elements, particularly around a central point.**Examining output transformations**\n\nI'm comparing the transformations between input and output rows. I\u2019m wondering if rotations or logical operations like AND between digits might reveal the patterns. However, it seems that instead, there's likely a visual or shape-counting aspect since the sample outputs transform digits like '9' into different values based on surrounding patterns.\n\nSpecifically, I noted that rows maintain a mirrored symmetry after a certain point and that patterns emerge distinctly once '9's are replaced. Row 10 from input matches an output row exactly, suggesting a rule where positions are swapped, leading to the development of repeating shapes across the grid.**Exploring symmetry in transformation**\n\nI'm analyzing the mapping process for the samples provided. Each row\u2019s left and right segments seem to be formed from specific input rows. I\u2019m discovering patterns that suggest mirroring or folding along an axis and stitching together portions of adjacent rows. \n\nIt appears that in some cases, these transformations maintain symmetry, leading me to conclude that the output might end up being the same as the input due to this symmetry. Therefore, for the test input, it looks like the output equals the original grid!",
