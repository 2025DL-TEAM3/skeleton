Checking closely, I can see the 9's are consistently in column 3 across all rows but only horizontal in row 2. \n\nI see that the '3's create a symmetric pattern, indicating a plus sign. To solve this, I might need to calculate distances from the central axis defined by the 9's to the nearest non-zero value on the left, possibly using '8' to mark certain rows. In rows 1 and 3, the left side of '9' has zeros, suggesting no '4's there.**Exploring regions and output widths**\n\nI'm considering splitting the regions based on the '9's. In example 2, the first '9' appears in column 4, so I\u2019m looking at columns 1-3 for the left part. I realized that the output width should correspond to the number of columns before the '9' region. In example 3, the region begins at column 6, but I\u2019m puzzled why the output width is only 4. \n\nI should double-check the '9's and '5's; the latter seem to be the dividing line in example 3. So, maybe they\u2019re splitting at the '5's. That could explain the widths not matching up!**Analyzing region shapes and outputs**\n\nIn the right part of row 3, I see a 5 that might simplify things, but the output shows an 8. I\u2019m considering whether the output reflects the left region onto the right region's shape, which appears as an L shape. In example 1, the right region is a vertical bar of 9's and a horizontal bar of 3's.\n\nFor output, the center seems to be marked at row 2, column 2, which matches the '8'. In example 2, the output is also 080 at row 3, indicating symmetry or a unique characteristic. The row with exactly two zeros is marked, leading me to think that marking might relate to some pattern of non-zero values or specific arrangements in the region. I'll need to re-evaluate and check each row's attributes again.",
