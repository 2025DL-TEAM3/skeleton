    "reasoning": "**Identifying transformation rules**\n\nI'm looking at three training examples, aiming to deduce a transformation rule. Each example seems to fill entire rows with specific digits. \n\nFor instance, the second row with \"600006\" transforms to \"666666,\" indicating we take the non-zero digit from each row and fill the entire row with that digit. Rows with only zeros remain unchanged. So, zeros keep their zeros, while the rows filled with a non-zero digit get transformed based on that digit.**Analyzing transformation rules further**\n\nWith the row \"100001,\" filling it with ones gives \"111111.\" Now for the second example, \"2528883\" produces \"2528883\" repeatedly in the output, despite having distinct non-zero digits. It seems rows with multiple distinct non-zero digits influence others. \n\nSo, if a row has diverse digits, its pattern is replicated across all rows. The third input shows \"4348,\" \"7777,\" and \"4643,\" where only the second row transforms. I need to analyze how \"7777\" becomes \"4747\" and what that means for the overall rule.**Formulating new transformation rules**\n\nI need to figure out how the transformation occurred from \"7777\" to \"4747.\" The first and last rows have distinct patterns, while the uniform rows seem to depend on the columns. \n\nFor example, the uniform rows take elements from the columns of special rows \u2014 if those rows have the same digit, the uniform rows adopt that digit. When the digits differ, the uniform rows retain their original digit. So, \"4747\" results from mixing elements from its surrounding rows based on this column-wise approach. Let's see if this reasoning holds with further examples!**Establishing rules for transformations**\n\nI'm setting out to identify special rows with more than one distinct digit, excluding zeros. For each column, if all special rows share the same digit, I should overwrite uniform rows with that digit; otherwise, I leave the uniform digits unchanged.\n\nHowever, I realize there's some inconsistency: in the previous examples, it seems I also modify special rows rather than just the uniform rows. Perhaps I need clearer definitions. Let's classify the rows into types A (all zeros), B (one unique non-zero digit), and C (multiple non-zero digits). This distinction should help clarify how to handle each type when transforming the data further!",
