Each cell's digit seems to change based on a specific pattern. In the first example, within certain rows and columns, digits of 5 are turned into 2, while edge values remain unchanged. The grid's pattern shows two 3x3 blocks of 5's, separated by rows and columns of 9's. I'm piecing this together step by step!**Analyzing digit patterns**\n\nI'm examining the patterns in this grid puzzle. The first input illustrates how 5's in specific positions change to 2's except at the borders. For instance, in row 1, the transformation from 559555595 to 559222295 shows that the 5's nestled between 9's become 2's, while edge values remain 5. \n\nIn the second example, similar transformations occur where 5's morph into other digits like 2, 4, and 6 at various positions. This pattern seems to imply some kind of erosion effect on these blocks!**Mapping the color blocks**\n\nI\u2019m working through a grid with three distinct blocks: top, middle, and bottom, each divided into left, middle, and right segments. For Block 1, only the central segment changes to color 2, leading to the output row of \"8022208.\" Moving to Block 2, all segments transform: left to 4, middle to 6, right to 3, generating \"4066603\" for rows 3-5. Lastly, Block 3 keeps edge colors while the center shifts to 1, resulting in \"8011108.\" The complete output grid features seven rows, all consistent.",
