    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformation**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC problem that involves inferring transformations from small input grids. The input is a 3x2 grid, which consists of three rows: \"00\", \"23\", and \"02\". The output, a 9x4 grid, seems to derive from this input by tiling it into blocks. Essentially, it appears that the output contains combinations of the input arranged in a mosaic-like fashion, reflecting the structure of the input while expanding its size. I need to ensure I visualize this correctly.**Examining grid dimensions**\n\nI'm analyzing how the output dimensions relate to the input grid. In the first example, the output height is three times the input height and the width is double. So with an input grid of 3x2, the output becomes 9x4. In the second example, the transformation changes the output to 9x9. It seems like the width for the second input remains consistent at three while the height increases accordingly. This suggests I need to consider how each non-zero cell in the input generates blocks in the output, potentially creating a repeating pattern.**Constructing output blocks**\n\nI\u2019m working on building the output based on the input blocks. For block row 1, I only have a relevant input cell at (1,0) with the value '2', while the others are zeros. This means I\u2019ll create a 2x3 block starting at row 2 and column 0 in the output.\n\nFor the output: the first two rows will be all zeros, while the next two rows will contain '006' and '260' respectively, followed by zeros. So the final output clearly becomes:\n\n000000000  \n000000000  \n006000000  \n260000000  \n\nI believe I've followed the correct structure!",
