For example, with 7 rows and 9 columns, the result shows a cropping effect to 4 rows and 6 columns, likely highlighting where the 7's are concentrated. In the given grid, the first three rows are uniform, while the last row contains variations, particularly at certain positions. My final output consists of three rows of \"777777\" followed by \"777177.\"**Identifying anomaly columns**\n\nI'm trying to determine which columns to cut based on anomalies, particularly focusing on removing columns with '4's. It seems they might want to focus on areas where '4's are absent. I found that column 3 is all '4's, so I should definitely remove that one. It looks like they might have also removed columns 1 and 2, given the output's width of 6. \n\nIt also seems like they may have removed any rows containing numbers that aren\u2019t '7' or '9'. I'll need to confirm which non-4 columns map correctly to the output.**Evaluating column removals**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to get to the output by potentially removing columns that disrupt the pattern, especially focusing on those with numbers that aren\u2019t '7' or '9'. If I cut out columns 1, 2, and 3, what remains is all '7's, matching the output for the first rows. However, row 4 is puzzling: it has a '1' in the output, but neither row 4 of the input nor any clear source holds a '1'.  \n\nIt seems like output row 4 might be linking to a different row, likely rows 6 or 7, since they contain the necessary digits. This leads me to think there's a selection involved, manipulating columns to achieve the final format with some digit swapping. I need to keep exploring the column selections to clarify how the output aligns with the input.**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nIn Example 3, I'm looking at how a 9x9 grid transforms into a 6x6 one after removing three rows and three columns. I suspect the most frequent number (probably '2') serves as a background color. By examining individual counts, I see that rows heavily populated by '2's will affect the selection of columns. The final output digits appear to come from a mapping based on these most frequent occurrences. However, the specific transformations between the input's clusters and their outputs need further unpacking. I\u2019m exploring how rows and columns correspond to output anomalies for a clearer view.",
