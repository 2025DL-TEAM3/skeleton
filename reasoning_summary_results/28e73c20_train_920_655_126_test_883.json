    "reasoning": "**Mapping digit sequences**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing sequences like 7772 to 3333. It seems like 7 maps to 3 for positions 1-3, but the last digit, 2, is also influencing the output. For 7887 to 7883, it\u2019s a pattern where everything corresponds, with the last digit changing. Looking at 7474 to 3373, there\u2019s some specific mapping, possibly preserving certain digits in specific positions. The consistency in the third position raises questions about how those mappings can shift elsewhere depending on the sequence.**Analyzing digit patterns**\n\nI'm examining the pattern in digit sequences, particularly focusing on the third position. For 7887, the third digit remains unchanged, while in 7772, it doesn\u2019t. I suspect the method might involve counting neighbors or some shape interpretation using colored grids. This could mean transforming certain digits based on their position and neighbor counts. In grids like the one formed by 72402 to 33333, I see a pattern where values change based on their surroundings, with some digits preserved. The preservation reflects a specific shape or path in the grid.**Exploring connected regions**\n\nI'm analyzing how digits change in a grid, focusing on which remain as 3. For example, in row 3, the digit 7 stays, while in row 4, the 4 remains unchanged. It seems like preserved positions may form a diagonal shape or a continuous line. The idea pops up that I'm looking for cells connected by neighbors. The largest group of preserved digits contains connections mainly from 7s and 8s. I need to ensure connectivity among positioned groups while retaining matching original values, prompting me to refine the criteria for preservation.**Examining spiral paths**\n\nI'm checking the visited cells for a spiral path with dimensions m=8 and n=5. The total visits add up to 24, which matches the area of 6x4 cells, indicating full coverage in this example. However, in another example, only 12 out of 24 cells were preserved, suggesting it didn't complete the spiral entirely. It looks like the expected shape is an L shape along the inner border, with adjustments needed in the path based on specific conditions in the input. So, I'll apply this L shape to the grid.",
