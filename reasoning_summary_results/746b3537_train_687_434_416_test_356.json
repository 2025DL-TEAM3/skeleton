    "reasoning": "**Analyzing unique rows**\n\nI'm working through a list of input rows that feature three-digit numbers. After processing, it looks like I've ended up with eight unique single digits, by removing consecutive duplicates. For instance, since both rows 4 and 5 contain \"222,\" I removed one. This led to focusing on the first digit of each remaining unique row.\n\nAs I consider another example with \"88\" and \"66,\" it seems necessary to remove the repeating digit from \"66\" to keep it concise.**Compressing sequences**\n\nI'm analyzing a sequence of digits, noting how to keep certain values and skip others based on repetition. For the rows of twos, since there are six in a row, the first is kept, but all subsequent twos are skipped until I encounter a one, which I keep. I apply this compression logic throughout, resulting in an output list.\n\nNext, for another example, I flatten digits and assess their counts. After applying the same compression rules, the output simplifies neatly!**Understanding output format**\n\nI'm analyzing how to format the output based on input rows. The examples show that both single rows and multiple rows can work. In cases of multiple digits, outputs can be presented as either single-digit rows or a string without separators. Each example maintains their respective structures, with compressed outputs resulting in various dimensions.\n\nI notice that the orientation\u2014whether wide or tall\u2014affects how I should present the output. For the input \"9664444444,\" which is a single wide row, my output will simply be \"964\" reflecting that format.",
