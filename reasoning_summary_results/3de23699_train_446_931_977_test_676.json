    "reasoning": "**Analyzing output mapping**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand how the blob in rows 3-5 and columns 2-6 creates a rectangle that matches the output dimensions. The pattern is a sequence of numbers: 2s and 1s, which correspond to certain input values in the specified area. It seems that there's a mapping going on, where 5 becomes 2 and 1 remains 1. However, the output doesn't directly reflect the expected transformation, leading me to verify the mapping's accuracy in the output.**Mapping colors in regions**\n\nI\u2019m working through the mapping process where I translate the inside region's 5s to 2s and keep 1s as is. I need to identify the inner area framed by the border. The input example has a 6x7 shape, and the outside frame consists of 4s, with some 7s marking specific points. The goal is to distinguish the inside region that doesn't touch the border. The border colors are important for identifying the background, which seems to include multiple colors like 1s and 2s at edges. The edge colors are key to defining the boundary of the shape.**Understanding color mapping**\n\nI'm analyzing how to handle the mapping within the inside region, particularly with the bounding box from rows and columns. The original pattern of numbers shifts, where 5s become 2s, and 1s remain 1s. I notice inconsistencies in the mapping, like different rules applying based on the colors of the borders. Each example defines the main region colors, background, and border colors, helping me understand how to map them correctly. I need to ensure that non-border cells accurately represent the interior and background appropriately, following the same logical adjustments in each case.**Defining the cropping process**\n\nI'm figuring out how to extract the region of interest based on specific rows and columns. So, I need to keep rows between openings and find the minimum and maximum row indices, excluding the opening rows. This same principle applies to columns, ensuring I capture cells strictly between the first and last occurrences of the opening color. The mapping of colors will also be essential, so I must make sure to differentiate between the shape and background colors as I finalize the output.",
