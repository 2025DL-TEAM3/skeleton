I\u2019m trying to spot a clear pattern in how the digits are reorganized. I need to align the transformations to uncover the underlying rule.**Analyzing digit patterns**\n\nI'm diving into a puzzle where the input digits seem to reveal a specific pattern used to transform numbers. For instance, in the input \"1111112727,\" I notice the output rearranges digits by descending count and value. The prefix \"727211\" consists of unique digits repeated: \"7\" and \"2\" are each listed twice, followed by \"1\" appearing twice. It seems they alternate counts for digits and maintain specific orders, although I\u2019m still figuring out the connection and any fixed repetition rules. This is interesting!",
