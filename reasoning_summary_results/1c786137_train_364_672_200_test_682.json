I'm considering counting specific digits or their appearances, like how many numbers show up an odd number of times, or perhaps shapes and holes in the digits.\n\nI wonder if I should focus on counting the digit 4 and its occurrences in each row. In the first grid, it appears only once, which doesn\u2019t match the output. I'll keep exploring this!**Exploring grid patterns**\n\nI'm trying to determine counts in the grids. In the first grid, I counted the number of holes but that didn't match the output. In another grid, the output is 8, and I suspect it might relate to the most frequent digit. As I count across rows, I notice ties between digits, which makes things tricky. I'm considering if the outputs reflect something like connected components or clusters of distinct digits. Maybe it\u2019s about symmetry or patterns when the grids are rotated? I'll keep refining this!",
