Oddly, there\u2019s been no shift in position; row 4 is unchanged. Row 3, with its all-nines block, appears to act as a separator to distinguish patterns, where rows 4 and 5 contain some threes. Essentially, there seem to be blocks of homogeneous rows tied together by these features.**Exploring row patterns**\n\nIn example 2, we have homogeneous rows of 999 from 0-3, with a feature block at rows 4 and 5. Row 6 shows a homogeneous 222, followed by 999 at rows 7-8. It looks like they inserted a separator of eights above the feature block. In example 1, the feature block was just one row (111115), which led to a shift, with row 4 becoming row 5. In example 2, they replaced row 3 instead. This leaves me wondering about the pattern blocks and why there's inconsistency in how rows are replaced or moved.**Identifying and marking anomalies**\n\nI'm analyzing how anomalies are handled in the examples. In example 1, the majority color is 5, and they seem to take the largest block of uniform rows at the top, changing the bottom-most row to eights. For example 3, I notice they highlighted a vertical region by modifying a specific column to all eights. This consists of various colors; thus, I see the importance of marking regions of non-default colors effectively. The surrounding approach differs between horizontal and vertical depending on the detected pattern.**Identifying and adjusting pattern regions**\n\nI\u2019m examining rows where the values primarily consist of threes, but then row 3 has a four, making it non-uniform. I see that all rows\u20140 to 5\u2014contain at least one value that isn\u2019t three, so they all count as pattern rows. The bounding box I determine spans rows 0 to 5 and columns 3 to 4. Since the width and height suggest a vertical orientation, I\u2019ll replace all values in column 2 with eights, resulting in a revised output for each row.",
