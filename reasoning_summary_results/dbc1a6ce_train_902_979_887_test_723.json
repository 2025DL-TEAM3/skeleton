    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation rules**\n\nI'm considering which 2's turn into 8's. It seems like only 2's enclosed by 5's form the target shape. I\u2019m examining the grid for patterns, particularly in rows filled with 2's and 5's. The transformation changes those interior 2's to 8's, while 5's remain as boundaries. For instance, in the grid, I've noticed that in specific rows like the first and fourth, the last two 2's turn into 8's when they're enclosed. It's about identifying the right shape!**Defining the transformation rules**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid that outlines a circle with value 8, marking the boundary of the contiguous blob of value-2 cells. The rule appears to be finding cells with value 2 at the boundary\u2014those adjacent to non-2 cells\u2014changing them to 8 while keeping the interior 2's intact. However, I'm noticing that row and column neighbors aren't the only consideration; diagonal neighbors seem to matter too. For example, a 2 changes to an 8 if any neighbor in the eight surrounding cells is not 2.**Exploring transformation logic**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to determine where to place 8's based on the 2's and 5's in the grid. The idea is to possibly find 2's and see their transposed positions. However, I\u2019m realizing that the outline needs to focus on the convex corners and edges of the shape formed by 2's. It seems like the goal is to highlight specific boundary points of the shape using 8's, particularly at a consistent distance from the boundaries. I\u2019ll compute distances to identify these key positions effectively.**Analyzing shapes and connections**\n\nI'm exploring how to identify the shapes formed by 1's and 4's in the input grid. It looks like the 4's are surrounded by 1's, and the goal is to outline the 4's shape with 8's on the adjacent 1's. The 4's seem to form a circle, so I'll use 8's to mark the perimeter on the surrounding 1's. For example, in a grid with zeros, I notice clusters and will draw connecting paths between them using 8's based on Bresenham's algorithm. This helps visualize the relationships in the shapes.",
