Interestingly, there are four occurrences of 9448, but the output only presents it twice. I wonder which rows are being referenced?**Examining input rows for patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the input rows, specifically row 3 to row 8. It seems we might be extracting 2x2 clusters from 4x4 blocks. I see that row 2 is made entirely of 1s and row 5 of 3s, which could indicate uniformity in the output. The two middle rows of output repeat the pattern 9448, but I\u2019m puzzled as to why only two of those rows are used in the output when there are four occurrences. The analysis of example two has uniform aspects too, but nothing pure. I need to clarify this.**Analyzing input structures for patterns**\n\nI'm examining example 2, noting the width of 10 and focusing on columns 5 to 8. That looks correct, but for width 9, they used positions 3 to 6 instead. I\u2019m wondering if they select blocks that avoid the majority value, as seen in example 1 where anomalies appear in a 9x4 area. Rows 2 to 5 seem to capture significant changes, but the selection criteria aren't consistent across examples. I'm curious if they always choose the first fully uniform row as a starting point. It seems there's much to clarify!",
