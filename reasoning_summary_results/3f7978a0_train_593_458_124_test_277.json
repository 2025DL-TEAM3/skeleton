    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid values**\n\nI'm considering cropping around the two distinct central values that aren\u2019t 7. To find the minimal bounding box of non-7 values, I see that 5 and 1 appear centrally. Row 1 has '5' at columns 4 and 7; Row 2 has '1' at those same columns. For Row 3, I note all non-7 positions come from columns 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. It looks like I\u2019ll focus on the first five rows for the output, ignoring the extras at the bottom.**Identifying non-3 cells**\n\nI'm listing non-3 cells from the grid based on their coordinates and values. The values seem to form a cluster starting at (1,1) and extending through adjacent cells. I notice that the cluster includes almost all non-3 values except for (1,8). The bounding box for this cluster covers rows 1 to 5 and columns 1 to 5. However, despite the presence of non-3 values in row 5, the output only includes rows 1 to 4, possibly because they are focusing on the core symmetrical shape of the cluster.**Understanding shape clusters**\n\nIn this task, I'm analyzing a grid to identify shapes based on their pixel values. The first grid appears to form an elliptical shape, displaying symmetry in both dimensions. The subsequent shapes also reflect similar characteristics and proportions, indicating they may represent various instances of shapes repeated across the grids. \n\nHowever, the second grid might be more complex, possibly containing two separate clusters connected through overlapping patterns. I need to ensure I identify complete clusters while avoiding any partial row noise. The process involves defining bounding boxes to extract only the significant shapes.",
