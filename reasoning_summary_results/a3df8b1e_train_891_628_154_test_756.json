    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation rules**\n\nI need to uncover the transformation rules applied to the input grids based on given examples. The first example shows a 2x8 grid where all values turn into 2s. The second example involves an 8x4 grid, with various inputs leading to a specific 8x4 output pattern. Lastly, I notice a 9-row output resembling a repeating pattern for a 3-column input. Understanding this transformation is crucial as it seems to involve some grid manipulation, possibly like flood fill or corner adjustments.**Examining grid patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the transformation rules based on the examples provided. In example 3, the first row remains the same while the other rows alternate in a checkerboard style, suggesting a repeating pattern of 5s and 6s. For example 2, I notice a symmetry in the output that seems to involve rotations and specific edge patterns. This leads me to hypothesize that there\u2019s a method to detect where the input differs from a dominant background number, possibly using shortest paths. It seems like flooding is at play when a special number touches the border!**Investigating grid patterns and outputs**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand how to determine the output for these grids using distances from specific anchor points. For instance, I look at special points and their parities relative to a seed point, checking how to generate outputs based on their positions. It seems that some outputs have alternating values depending on even or odd distances. I've noticed consistent L-shaped patterns in several examples, suggesting that I could replicate an L shape across the grid as a repeating pattern. I\u2019ll continue exploring how these segments define relationships in my final outputs.**Generating output grid**\n\nI\u2019m applying a test with a special color of 6 and a background color of 8. I'm trying to use the formula (r+c)%2==0 to determine the values. For the rows I'm calculating, I notice a repeating pattern that matches a checkerboard style, where 6s and 8s alternate. It looks like for a 7-column grid, I can predict the output pattern will alternate as:  \n\n```\n6868686\n8686868\n6868686\n8686868\n6868686\n```  \n\nThis seems consistent with the style in previous examples, so I feel confident about this prediction.",
