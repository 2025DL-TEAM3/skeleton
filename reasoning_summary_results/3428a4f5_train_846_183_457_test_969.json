Observing output entries shows they are either 3 or 0, with 0 occurring at certain positions where the input has a 4. It looks like there are many mismatches, so I'll visualize both the input and output in grids to get a clearer picture.\n\nFor Input1, I see variations where row1 col1 has 7 and row1 col2 has 0, suggesting a possible mirroring effect. Maybe the 3x3 output aligns with a specific 3x3 corner of the input?**Analyzing input-output correlations**\n\nI'm comparing the left three columns of input for each row against the output values. For instance, with row0, the input shows all zeros, while the output gives three threes. In row1, there's a 7, leading to a 0 in the output compared to the previous row. Row2 has a 7 leading to a 0, while row3 has discrepancies. \n\nLooking at training2, it appears that input from the leftmost two columns likely influences the outputs, but conflicts arise due to varying values in those columns. I might need to explore columns three and four for more patterns.**Examining input-output relationships**\n\nI'm analyzing how output columns may correspond to colored groups or distinct shapes in the input, particularly where zeros appear. For example, in Training3, I see that the output compresses rows while maintaining the width. This leads me to think about whether I should compress based on the orientation or repeating blocks in columns. \n\nIn looking at the output, I notice that zero values and unique counts seem to influence the patterns. It seems like I might be mapping the input's characteristics into the output more directly than I realized, collapsing specific rows while summarizing others.",
