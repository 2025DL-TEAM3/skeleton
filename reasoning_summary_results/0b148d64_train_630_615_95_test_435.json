    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid digits**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an 8x8 grid of numbers and specifically examining the digits 5, 9, and 6. The goal is to identify all the occurrences of 6s. It seems like they are concentrated in the last column of the last three rows (rows 6, 7, and 8), where I find that 6 appears in column 8. Thus, the output would be a 3x1 grid showing '6' for each of those rows, resulting in three rows of '6'.**Identifying unique digit regions**\n\nI'm looking at the input grid and need to extract coherent regions of unique digits. For example, in one grid, I identify a vertical line of '6's across three rows, which corresponds to my output of three rows and one column of '6's. In another grid with '8's at the start of row 8, those appear as a distinct group, resulting in output of '8888' in one row and four columns. I need to continue finding unique shapes in the next example, focusing on distributions of digits 5, 9, and 6.**Finding bounding boxes of least frequent digits**\n\nI'm examining the grid examples to identify unique connected shapes. In the second example, the shape is determined by the '8's located in row 8, yielding a simple 1x4 grid. As for the third example, I see the most connected cluster of '6's has a size of three in column 10, but I realize the bounding box I need is larger, encompassing all occurrences of '6', resulting in a 5x1 grid. For the puzzle input grid, I\u2019ll count occurrences of digits 2, 3, and 7 to find which appears the least and extract the corresponding subgrid.**Counting and extracting digits**\n\nI'm counting occurrences of digits in the grid. For '2', I find it only appears 5 times in row 10 at columns 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. Next, I count '3's across each row, totaling up to 29 occurrences, followed by '7's, which fill in the rest with 66 counts. Since '2' is the least frequent, I focus on its bounding rectangle, which is row 10 and columns 1 through 6. Extracting that gives the output as \"227222,\" a single line of digits, matching the required format.",
