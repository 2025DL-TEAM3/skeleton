    "reasoning": "**Determining grid transformation rules**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an ARC task and need to deduce the transformation rule from given examples. In the first example, the input is a 3x8 grid, and the output becomes a 5x10 grid, suggesting that I add a border around it. Checking the subsequent examples confirms this pattern: the output consistently extends the dimensions by adding a row and a column around the original grid. So, it seems the rule is to pad the grid with an additional border.**Analyzing grid transformation with borders**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the padding rule for the grid transformation. It's not just simple border additions; the contents actually change as digits shift based on their neighbors. In the first example, I can see that the original grid is embedded in the inner rows and columns of the output. The corners consistently appear as zeros, like in the second example as well. So, the corners are zero, and I need to formulate how each border cell is derived. This confirms a pattern for constructing the new grid.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m calculating the output grid row by row, based on the specified rules. For each row of the output B, I start by setting the corners and edges. The first row is populated with the appropriate values from the original grid, with zeros at both ends. Each subsequent row mirrors the original, appending values as needed and confirming that the border cells match the expected patterns. After compiling all rows, I double-check to ensure consistency and correct dimensions, confirming the final output.
