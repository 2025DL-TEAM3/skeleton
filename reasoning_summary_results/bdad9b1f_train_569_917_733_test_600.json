I\u2019m suspecting that there could have been a mix-up with col6. After writing out the indices, it becomes clear that the shape positions are fundamentally at col1 and col7, with col7 holding the value 6. The transformation I\u2019m doing involves stamping the L-shape with a color base of 3 and highlight of 4 while keeping unchanged those with cluster1.**Clarifying shape clusters**\n\nFor rows with only cluster2 (like row1), I\u2019m replacing them by stamping the L-shape with a base of 3 and a highlight of 4. Rows without any clusters, such as row0, seem to default to a base value, but since row0 has no non-background shapes, it gets converted to 0700000600.\n\nI realize there are two distinct shape clusters: the L-shape and a horizontal 2-block of 3s. The main shape appears to be the L-shape, which has both horizontal and vertical components. For each unique color in the grid, I\u2019ll stamp the main shape's mask, ensuring each group is filled correctly while keeping the respective colors intact in their rows.**Reassessing color recoloring rules**\n\nI noticed they changed row2 from 1166866 to 1111411, despite row2 having an S pixel at col4. It seems if a row contains only S and background, it should remain unchanged, but the presence of a sub-shape cluster prompts a recoloring. So for rows with color clusters, the S and background colors should match those of the sub-shape.\n\nFor each row, the rule should be clear: if it's only background and S, leave it. If there's a sub-shape, recolor based on that. Highlight color 4 is exclusive for sub-shapes while main shapes use their original highlight colors. I\u2019ll carefully evaluate mask positions and colors in these rows to ensure accurate transformation.",
