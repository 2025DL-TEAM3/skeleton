    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation patterns**\n\nI'm trying to derive a transformation rule from the given examples. In the first example, some lines remain unchanged while others change, suggesting a possible pattern based on mirroring or reflecting digits. I\u2019m noting which rows change and which don\u2019t.\n\nIn the second example, I notice a cross-hair shape and diamond pattern emerging in the output based on the changes in the central row. It all points to some reflection around the center of each row. Let's keep exploring!**Understanding pixel propagation**\n\nIt seems like the transformation involves taking the central pixel and spreading it diagonally outward. In the first example, the '3' remains in the center while spreading to other positions in its rows. This creates a symmetry. \n\nIn the next example with '7', it behaves similarly, spreading outwards in a diamond shape. The distortion follows a distance pattern, not orthogonal but specific to diagonals. \n\nAdditionally, I\u2019m noticing that multiple non-zero digits might combine to influence the output, mapping positions to create new values. I\u2019ll dig deeper into this!**Establishing transformation rules**\n\nI\u2019m observing how the center pixel propagates its value diagonally across the grid. It looks like any unique non-zero pixel determines where the values spread.\n\nFor the grid provided, '4' appears once at the center, acting as the pivot. When I draw the X shape from this center, it replaces values along those diagonals without affecting other non-zero elements outside that line. \n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that the unique value indicates how to execute the transformation. Let\u2019s implement this with the current input!**Transforming grid values**\n\nTo transform the grid, I\u2019m identifying diagonal positions based on the pivot, ensuring the diagonal equation holds true. This entails setting the specific cell values to 4 wherever the absolute index differences align.\n\nI\u2019ve validated the central pivot for various examples, confirming that this unique center directs the value propagation. As I calculate the output, I\u2019ll replace the diagonal cells accordingly while keeping other non-zero values intact, leading to the final transformed grid. Let\u2019s generate the output!",
