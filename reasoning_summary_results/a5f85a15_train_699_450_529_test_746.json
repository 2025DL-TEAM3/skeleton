For Row 6, I again changed a digit to get 1111114111. Row 7 was unchanged. In Row 8, I changed the second 7 to a 4 but discovered both 7s were important: one in position 1 and the other in position 9. So, in the output, that's 7111111141 where the second 7 becomes a 4.**Evaluating color change patterns**\n\nI'm considering how examples indicate color changes in a puzzle context. In example 1, there were two 6s, and it seemed we were changing one without adjacent 6s. The puzzles often center on outlier shapes or highlighting a specific number. With example 2, rather than just focusing on the rightmost, I found leftmost instances were also changed. And then I noticed symmetry in the training data but discovered inconsistencies in outputs. I need to refine my analysis around how the patterns are structured in example 3.**Analyzing number patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the rows of numbers. The changes occur only in rows 2, 4, and 10 where 757 becomes 747 by changing the middle 5 to a 4. The rows with 575 and 775 stay unchanged. So, I see a pattern where 5s flanked by 7s are converted. In training data, I noticed that 6s don\u2019t fit this rule as they weren't flanked correctly when changed. I\u2019ll need to take a closer look at why only certain 7s in training were altered, even when they were flanked by 1s.**Finalizing grid changes**\n\nI'm processing the changes for the rows in the grid. For row 4, I changed the character in column 2 from 5 to 4, resulting in 34333. For row 6, I also modified column 4 from 5 to 4, yielding 33343. Similarly, row 10 becomes 34333 after the change. After confirming, both row 4 and row 10 are indeed 34333. So, my final output grid is consistent across the relevant rows, and everything looks great!",
