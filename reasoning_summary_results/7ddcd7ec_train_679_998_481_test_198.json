    "reasoning": "**Analyzing slope propagation**\n\nI'm thinking about why one diagonal is chosen over the other. For the diagonal from (5,7) to (6,8), the slope is (1,1) and it has a sequence of two zeros, while the diagonal from (5,10) to (6,9) has a slope of (1,-1) also with two zeros. However, the slope +1 diagonal is the one that gets extended with zeros appearing at (4,6), not on the off-grid (4,11) from the other diagonal. It seems only the diagonal that effectively propagates is selected, limiting the possible additional cells.**Understanding diagonal extensions**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out the rules for filling diagonals in a grid. The goal is to find any diagonal segment of the same color with two consecutive coordinates that can extend to fill at least one blank cell. Each training session highlights exactly one diagonal that produces an extension. \n\nFor example, in one case, the slope +1 diagonal at (5,4) and (6,5) extends to (7,6). In another case, the slope -1 diagonal of 9s from (2,6) to (3,5) extends as well. I need to check for non-background colors and their coordinates for further filling.**Calculating grid extensions**\n\nI'm analyzing diagonal segments to see where I can fill cells. I found two diagonals: one with slope +1 that goes from (4,7) to (5,8), which can extend backward, and one with slope -1 from (5,9) to (6,8), which can't extend as there are conflicts.\n\nI can fill the zeros in (3,6), (2,5), and (1,4) effectively. The filled grid will look like this: \n\n111011111  \n111101111  \n111110111  \n111111011  \n111111109  \n111111195  \n\nDouble-checked everything to ensure it's accurate!",
