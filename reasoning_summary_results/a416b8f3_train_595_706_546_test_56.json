    "reasoning": "**Analyzing puzzle duplication**\n\nI'm looking at this puzzle where each output line seems to be formed by duplicating the corresponding input line. For example, the input \"9995\" produces \"99959995,\" which is just \"9995\" repeated twice. This pattern holds for other examples too: \"5999\" becomes \"59995999,\" \"9999\" turns into \"99999999,\" and \"5959\" into \"59595959.\" It seems clear now that the rule is to simply duplicate each input line to create the output.**Identifying duplication rule**\n\nI'm analyzing another example related to duplicating input lines. For instance, \"38857\" becomes \"3885738857,\" showing the pattern of duplicating each input. This is consistent through other examples like \"884\" to \"884884\" and \"888\" to \"888888.\" So, the output indeed reflects horizontal doubling, where each row in the output is the input repeated. For a new input set like \"467,\" \"803,\" and \"152,\" the output would be \"467467,\" \"803803,\" and \"152152.\" In each case, the format stays consistent with six digits per line.",
