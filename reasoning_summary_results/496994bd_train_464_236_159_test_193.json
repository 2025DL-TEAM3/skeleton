    "reasoning": "**Analyzing symmetry in outputs**\n\nI'm exploring a 9x8 output, focusing on a background digit that looks primarily like 8. The row input features multiple 8s, but there are some non-8s too. For instance, in row 1, the non-8s are at columns 6, 7, and 8, which get mirrored. So, when I look at the output, it appears I've generated the sequence 35688653, which is indeed a palindrome. Continuing to row 2, it seems to follow the same mirroring logic, outputting a symmetric shape, which tells me the pattern is consistent across the rows.**Understanding row symmetry**\n\nI'm analyzing how rows are filled to create horizontal symmetry. They take non-8 digits, position them, and mirror them while filling the middle with 8s. All rows contain something. For example, in row 8, 88888555 becomes 55588555, reflecting the three 5s at the end to the front, while keeping the middle 8s. Each symmetric output forms a palindrome, and this consistency applies across rows. The goal seems to focus on mirroring non-background digits around the center.",
