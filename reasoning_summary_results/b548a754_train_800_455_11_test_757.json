    "reasoning": "**Understanding transcription rules**\n\nI'm analyzing the input and output examples provided. In the first example, it seems like the numbers are grouped and aligned, possibly transforming an original format into a clearer one. Similarly, in the second example, we see a pattern where specific numbers have replaced others while maintaining a structure. \n\nI'm trying to identify the rule governing these transformations, particularly how input numbers are manipulated to achieve the output. It looks like there might be some systematic logic in how transformation takes place across different rows.**Analyzing example patterns**\n\nI'm looking closely at the examples and how colors are arranged. In each case, there's an outer border of color X, and then a potential inner region of color Y. For example, in the first input, while the outer border is clearly defined, the inner region has zeros and certain identified filled regions.\n\nIt seems they\u2019ve expanded the zero region to fill where colors originally existed, creating continuous rectangles. The zeros originally formed a hollow shape that was transformed, defining the area outlined by the borders and specific color placements. I think I need to clarify the rules around this bounding process and how regions evolve in the output.**Exploring frame expansion rules**\n\nI'm trying to understand the general rules for filling a colored rectangle frame with a segment. The idea is to expand the frame symmetrically around the segment. For instance, in example two, they extended the frame\u2019s height to 3. This means they had to adjust to preserve the overall shape, even if it isn't square.\n\nIt seems that the height is determined by the original frame's dimensions, and they can only expand where the background allows. My key takeaway is that the segment's orientation significantly influences how and where to expand the frame, which dictates whether they add rows or columns.",
