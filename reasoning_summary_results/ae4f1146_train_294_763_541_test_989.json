For example, in the first input grid with 10 rows and 7 columns, the outputs are \"15\" and \"11,\" which appear on separate lines. It seems the output grid represents a 2x2 structure, where the first row has digits 1 and 5, and the second row has 1 and 1. Now I wonder about the next example with 8 rows\u2014I'll need to see how that fits in.**Determining output rules**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an input grid of 8 rows and 7 columns, where the output seems to be \"10\" and \"11.\" This suggests a 2x2 grid of two-digit numbers. The next input grid has 7 rows and 8 columns with an output of \"15\" and \"15,\" reinforcing the 2x2 format.\n\nNow I'm considering that the rule may involve identifying subpatterns or counting contiguous shapes in the grid based on the digits present. My next step is to count the occurrences of specific digits in the grids to uncover this potential pattern.**Summarizing grid coverage**\n\nI need to be careful with the input grid analysis. A block starting at position (2,6) with a size of 2x2 covers certain positions: the top-left is (2,6) with a value of 2, the top-right (2,7) is also 2, the bottom-left (3,6) is 2, and the bottom-right (3,7) is 1. This gives me an output grid of \u201c22\u201d for the top row and \u201c21\u201d for the bottom, confirming that the correct output is:\n\n22  \n21  \n\nSo that's the result I\u2019ll return!",
