    "reasoning": "**Analyzing patterns of zeros**\n\nI\u2019m examining a grid structure where zeros appear to form specific shapes within certain rows and columns. For instance, in Row3, the zeros are located in columns 4, 5, and potentially others. The pattern suggests examining quadrants and counting zeros, leading to an organized output that presents a summary of zero distribution. Each part of the grid is revealing elements possibly related to input corners, hinting at a deeper relationship. I'll need to clarify further based on this exploration.**Mapping output corners**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the inputs, specifically the corners and how they relate to the output. It seems the outer corners in the output don\u2019t match the input corners. The outputs are suggesting an inner core after subtracting a value, but the digits aren't lining up. \n\nLooking at the second training data, I see a pattern where there's a border of 1s surrounding an inner area. The layout hints at a core section that will need further investigation. Let's clarify the relationship between the outer and inner layers.**Determining border distances**\n\nI\u2019m working on a method to measure distances from each cell in the inner region to the outer border. The idea is to see which side\u2014top, bottom, left, or right\u2014is closest. For example, from a cell at (r, c), I can calculate distances to the top, bottom, left, and right sides. I realize there might be a need for mapping these distances to values at the outer border and ensuring consistency in how those values are derived. It seems there's some confusion in expected outputs versus calculations, and I'll have to clarify how these connections should be made.**Verifying output matrix**\n\nI've generated an output matrix with specific values, and I\u2019m trying to confirm the pattern reflects a consistent shape. I'm closely examining how zeros are replaced by the nearest corner colors and checking mappings to ensure they align correctly. Random tests on cells show that my mapping is running smoothly, as evidenced by confirming the values correspond to their original positions. After double-checking entries, I can present the final output matrix confidently, affirming all rows match as expected. Everything appears consistent!",
