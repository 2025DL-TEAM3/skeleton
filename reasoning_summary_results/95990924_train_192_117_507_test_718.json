Checking row5 gives me \"666688666,\" indicating that the block is indeed at row5-6, col4-5. I see that columns 5 and 6 have 8s, while row4 shows \"666166266.\" This suggests that 1 is placed at col4 and 2 at col6. I might need to consider if they are marking distances as I analyze example2 with its 8s and 7s patterns.**Analyzing grid block positions**\n\nI\u2019m noting that there's a block of numbers formed at rows 5 and 6, columns 5-6, in a 10x9 grid. The numbers above should fill col4 and col7, with 1 in col4 and 2 in col7. Looking at the output for row 4, \"666166266,\" confirms this placement.\n\nFor row 7, \"666366466,\" it\u2019s similar, placing 3 at col4 and 4 at col7. I see the rule: for each 2x2 block of different colors, they mark adjacent numbers in the rows above and below. The corner numbers are positioned diagonally outside, confirming that the numbers 1-4 correspond to these corners.",
