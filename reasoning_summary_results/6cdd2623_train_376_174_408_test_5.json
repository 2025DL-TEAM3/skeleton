    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input structure**\n\nIn example 1, I see the width is 9, with indexes from 0-8 and sidebars at positions 1 and 6. Example 2 also has these indexes but with sidebars at 1 and 7, so there's inconsistency there. The sidebars in example 2 at col 1 and col 7 provide a spacing of 6, while example 1 has a spacing of 5. I\u2019m considering that the sidebars may correlate to where the most frequent colors occur. Ultimately, I think it\u2019s about deriving the shape from the input based on patterns of non-zero values.**Identifying dominant colors**\n\nI'm analyzing input to find the dominant color based on frequency. In input1, color 0 appears frequently, while color 3 shows up at border positions and in several locations: (0,1), (0,6), and others. For instance, in row5, I see the sequence '300007523', indicating a 3 at (5,8). It seems that 3s form a symmetric cross shape in various grid locations. \n\nThe output appears to reflect a fixed pattern rather than strictly following the input, likely using the most frequent non-zero color for the shape. In input1, it seems that 3 is the most frequent, while in example2, the dominant color is 9. In example3, again, 3 appears to dominate, with one full row of 1s at row6. I\u2019m curious why that row was chosen for the distinction!**Examining color positions and shapes**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing input data to identify color frequencies. For instance, in row 0, I see a predominance of color 3 with a single 1 at position 4. The output resembles a shape with horizontal and vertical components filled with respective colors. It seems the most frequent color is used for the background while the second most frequent forms the shape of a plus symbol. \n\nLooking deeper into input3, it seems that color 1 appears in various spots, but without any clear alignment, which makes determining structure challenging. The center for the plus shape would usually be at the midpoint, yet they opted for (6,4), which is curious. I will revisit the inputs to delve into color counts and confirm the shape's outlines.",
