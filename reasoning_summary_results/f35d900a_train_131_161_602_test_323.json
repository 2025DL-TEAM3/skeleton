    "reasoning": "**Examining border filling**\n\nI'm considering how to fill an \"onion\" border around a rectangle using special cells. First, I'll expand the rectangle from (row1, col2) to (row4, col7), giving us a 4x6 area. Then, I\u2019ll fill the top border with colors according to the corner colors, leaving the corners intact. The cells between the corners will get new colors based on some pattern. It seems like positions at (1,3) and (1,6) might serve as corner markers for this coloring.**Analyzing fill patterns**\n\nI'm exploring how the two special colors at the corners could propagate horizontally from (1,2) and (1,6) with a potential for a rotational fill pattern. This is tricky! I checked a similar example where the special colors are (1,1)=2, (1,6)=9, (4,1)=9, and (4,6)=2. The output shows how this affects filled rows, but it reveals cells beyond the bounding rectangle are filled with surrounding values. It seems like the bounding box encapsulates the active areas, leading to an interesting filling method based on nearby edges.**Examining filling patterns**\n\nI'm considering how a rectangle might be divided into quadrants using special corners. It seems they color the quadrants differently, with a central cross dividing columns and rows. However, when comparing outputs, I notice inconsistencies in how background colors are preserved or filled. In some cases, a new color is introduced, while others retain background values. For example, the third example appears only to swap colors rather than follow the same filling approach as the previous examples. It seems there might be distinct rules governing filler colors based on background visibility.",
