When looking at the input, I see that there are several positions forming a shape of 9's. I\u2019ll map their coordinates with rows and columns, for example, (4, 2), (4, 5) and (8, 2) through (8, 6). As I break down row 8, it reveals a pattern in the 9's while row 7 displays a vertical shape. I need to double-check each pattern to ensure accuracy.**Analyzing number patterns**\n\nI'm focusing on the 7's surrounding the contiguous region of 9's. Specifically, in this structure, I see that positions (4, 5) and (4, 6) form part of a larger pattern. In row 4, there are separate 9's at columns 2, 5, and 6, while in row 5, the 2's sit adjacent to these 9's. I need to examine the second example closely since it has a 10x9 configuration. The shapes and clusters of 3's in this row indicate interesting patterns, and I'll confirm how the changes affect the output rows.**Understanding cluster rectangles**\n\nI'm examining the clusters of numbers, specifically clusters B and C, which are identified in columns 3 and 5. I notice a potential bounding rectangle forming around the 3's but then things get a bit tricky. Rows 1 through 8 create a plus-shape in the input pattern, making a hollow region. Rows and columns connecting these shapes give a clearer idea of how the output is filled with 2's. I'm trying to determine the most appropriate way to mark these regions based on proximity to the 3's. It\u2019s definitely a complex structure!",
