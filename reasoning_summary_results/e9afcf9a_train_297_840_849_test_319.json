    "reasoning": "**Exploring checkerboard patterns**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to create a checkerboard pattern by interleaving adjacent rows of different colors. The idea is simple: for any two adjacent rows with distinct uniform colors, they would alternate to form a checkerboard look. For instance, if one row is all 0s and the other all 1s, the first row could become 01010 and the second 10101. However, I\u2019m noticing a confusion regarding output expectations based on provided examples. It's a bit tricky!**Clarifying row changes**\n\nI\u2019m noticing some contradictions with how rows are mixed. For instance, if row2 is 8, I would expect it to also create a checkerboard pattern like 808080, but it stayed unchanged. It seems they\u2019re only applying these changes to the first and last rows of blocks with similar values. In the example, row1 and row5 got altered, while rows 2 and 4 remained the same. This suggests a focus on the extremities of constant runs, where unique colors are considered. It's quite intricate!**Analyzing row changes**\n\nI'm noticing that rows 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9 got changed, while rows 3, 5, and 7 didn't. This makes me think there might be a pattern: maybe rows at odd indices are altered unless the color matches both neighboring rows. For instance, even though row3's input is 8 with differing neighbors, it remains unchanged. It seems any row touching the grid boundaries might be a target for changes, creating alternating patterns with adjacent colors. It's quite complex and intriguing!**Exploring grid changes**\n\nI'm working on understanding grid patterns, particularly how they create checkerboard designs using two colors based on unique and uniform rows. It seems the modification rules depend on row attributes and positions. For instance, if uniform rows share odd indices, they remain unchanged, while even ones alternate with a central color. Looking at examples, they frequently change the last occurrence of each color but also consider pairs of rows based on symmetry. I think I\u2019m getting closer to identifying a consistent rule!**Finalizing row transformations**\n\nI'm establishing a rule for handling symmetric pairs in a grid: if two rows are identical, they remain unchanged. If they differ, I'll fill them with alternating colors in a checkerboard pattern. For the first row of the pair, I'll start with its original color, while the second row starts with its own. Testing this on samples confirms the algorithm works well. I\u2019ve outlined how to implement this rule and tested it successfully with various row combinations!",
