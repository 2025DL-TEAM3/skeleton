    "reasoning": "**Analyzing symmetry in rows**\n\nI'm looking at a pattern and wondering if it has symmetry. As I map out the rows, I see that rows 1 and 2 are identical with 8636363, while rows 3 and 6 contain 6666666, and rows 4 and 5 have 3636363. Rows 7 and 8 feature 8636863, and I'm considering how transformations might change them. It seems there are three distinct patterns, and I need to clarify how changes between them affect overall symmetry. I'm noticing some pairs but still figuring out the exact transformations.**Examining digit transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing the difference between two patterns where D has an 8 in the 5th position and A has a 3. The only change occurs at position 5 across patterns. When I visualize them in a grid, I realize changes are happening through specific rules. It seems I'm observing a vertical symmetry in the digit arrangement, as certain positions in rows shift from 3 to 8 while maintaining others. This suggests a systematic way the patterns fill in while preserving a mirrored structure across layers. I need to clarify this transformation rule further.**Identifying grid patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing how patterns in the grid transform across rows. It looks like pairs of rows align with specific identifiers, and I see how certain entries shift while others remain consistent. For instance, rows 4-5 in the output are updated to match another pattern. It seems that blocks get converted to create symmetry vertically, although some might need adjustments. The interaction between these blocks suggests a dynamic approach, almost like a cellular automaton, where elements combine across rows to create a new cohesive representation. I\u2019ll dig deeper into how these transformations work.",
