Each input features colored segments or cells, which appear to shift in some way. For instance, in Task 1, it seems that the differing cell moves towards a specific position based on the majority color. The output rearranges the colors while keeping the majority dominant. I\u2019ll continue analyzing these patterns to establish a consistent rule.**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI'm noticing some oddities in the row outputs. For example, in Task 1, row 3, although it has an odd 8 in the input, the output becomes all 8s. Then in row 6, we start with all 8s and get transformed into a single pattern with one 8, reinforcing the idea of majority versus minority colors. It looks like the layout is consistently designed to place an 8 at column 3 for most rows except the distinct one. I'll summarize the findings: there\u2019s a pattern in selecting the minority color.**Investigating row transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the input rows and identifying odd entries, particularly focusing on the minority colors. It seems there's a pattern where a row containing only the minority color gets moved to specific positions across different training tasks. The consistent placement of a minority color occurs in column 3, but there are inconsistencies in how these rows are reorganized\u2014sometimes moving to the middle row or another. I'll need to clarify if there's a simpler rule guiding these movements or if it\u2019s purely based on frequency.",
