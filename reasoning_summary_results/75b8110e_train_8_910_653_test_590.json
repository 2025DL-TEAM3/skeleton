For various blocks, I compute the sums: Block0 gives 12, Block1 gives 20, and so on, all outputting 6. While the sums mod 10 don\u2019t match, I realize I might need to consider averages or rounding. For Block0, the average is 3, and doubling it gives 6, but for higher sums, it doesn't work. I\u2019m analyzing unique digit counts and potential patterns.**Reassessing block structure**\n\nI\u2019m rethinking the outputs, which consistently show 6 and 3. Maybe they\u2019re calculating the perimeter of a shape in the block, or the cells represent walls in a maze with numbers indicating orientation. I have a new test input that's 10x10, with a pattern that suggests a small shape surrounded by 6s. The top-left contains 2s, while the bottom-right shows mostly 6s with some 8s. I\u2019ll structure this input clearly to analyze the pattern further.**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the bottom-left region of my grid and noting that it shows 6s and 0s, leading to the output of \"33.\" This is puzzling since outputs are only 3s and 6s initially. I\u2019m considering if the numbers reflect \"bends\" or line segments in blocks. \n\nThe training sets yield varied outputs, not binary but different digits. I\u2019m unsure if averages of block values or something more complex is at play. It seems the puzzle could involve splitting the grid into regions with distinct shapes. Analyzing these relations could provide clearer insights into the outputs.",
