In this case, repeated columns indicate a vertical pattern, resulting in one column output. \n\nMy output would be:\n\n9  \n1  \n5  \n2  \n7  \n8  \n9  \n0  \n\nI need to make sure there\u2019s no trailing blank line. The grid concept isn\u2019t fitting here since the input's 5 width and 10 height repeat rows rather than columns.**Analyzing patterns in data**\n\nI\u2019m noticing both repeated rows and constant columns. They could have used a column orientation instead, but they chose horizontal. The rule seems to be detecting which dimension has length 1 with duplicates. If rows are identical, the sequence follows the row pattern; if columns are identical, it follows the column pattern. \n\nIn the provided example, while the rows are identical, the columns vary, so the output reflects the unique row data. The final output will be:\n\n9  \n1  \n5  \n2  \n7  \n8  \n9  \n0  \n\nSo, I\u2019ve confirmed the sequence!",
