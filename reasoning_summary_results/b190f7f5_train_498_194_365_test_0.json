    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid structure**\n\nI'm exploring how the grid structure works. It seems there are 3 blocks of 3x3 for each input cell, but the overall grid is 9x9. If the input is 3x6, maybe the output corresponds to 3 horizontal blocks, representing groups of input columns. Each input cell could map to a 3x3 block. I notice special positions in the output at columns 1, 4, and 7, corresponding to intersections in special rows. It\u2019s like a 9x9 grid with 3x3 blocks.**Mapping input to output blocks**\n\nI'm thinking about how input mappings relate to output blocks. For example, input cell (1,1) with a value of 6 maps to output (1,1) resulting in 0. The only special mapping here is that 6 transforms to 0. The default values of 3 for other inputs in block 1 don't get marked. \n\nWhen I look at block 2 (input columns 4-6), it seems they might correspond to output block 3. I notice an interesting pattern where non-3 outputs form a diagonal \"X\" shape across the grid. However, I see I\u2019m missing symmetrical positions, leading to some confusion in mapping logic. There are seven special positions noted, even though I initially expected eight. It\u2019s intriguing to unravel how these input transformations work!**Examining output grid dimensions**\n\nI'm analyzing the second example input, focusing on how colors correspond to outputs. The input colors reveal that the most frequent one, 2, is likely the background fill. For example three, I find that 5 becomes the dominant background color. It seems the output grid expands the input, creating 9 rows consistently across examples, while columns vary. Each output maintains 9 rows, yet columns reflect input size. I suspect a factor scales the columns. Ultimately, the output grid structure is consistently designed around these patterns.**Determining mapping offsets**\n\nI\u2019m working to understand how to map input values across an output grid, focusing on the offsets based on non-background counts in the first half. For the first example, the non-background count equals 3, leading to an offset of 1. The second example has a count of 1, resulting in an offset of 2. I realize that certain mappings appear symmetrical, while others do not, which might reflect how input values translate into output spaces. Ultimately, my approach will use a mapping style that aligns elements more aesthetically, guiding me to a final output.",
