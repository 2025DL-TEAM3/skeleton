It seems to relate to a shape based on non-homogeneous rows\u2014counting rows with different digits. The input has many 3s, along with a few other digits like 2, 8, and 9. In looking closely, I\u2019m marking the non-3 digits in each row and noting their positions. It appears these non-3s might form a specific pattern in a block that hints at a 6x6 region, particularly in the first six rows.**Determining bounding boxes**\n\nI\u2019m working on finding the minimal bounding box for the non-3 digits, determining that rows one through six and columns four to nine create a 6x6 region. However, the output is expected to be a 3x3 grid. I consider downsampling the 6x6 to half-size, checking if 2x2 blocks can reduce to a single number. When looking at an example matrix, I find the extracted submatrix aligns perfectly with the output! \n\nIn the second example, I notice that digits 6 and 7 appear frequently, leading to a matching 4x4 submatrix for the output. It\u2019s interesting how these patterns emerge!**Identifying anomaly regions**\n\nI'm analyzing how non-9 digits are extracted from an 8x8 grid, focusing on the top-left 4x4 region. It seems they often consider regions of interest based on where these anomalies appear. In the second example, I see how the output matches the top-left quadrant.\n\nIn the third example with 10 rows and 9 columns, I find that anomalies arise from specific rows and columns. The bounding box includes all identified non-9s but only a smaller quadrant is used for output, likely to isolate clusters of anomalies. It seems they often prioritize the most densely packed area of anomalies in that quadrant.**Calculating quadrant transformations**\n\nI'm computing the quadrants from a grid, starting with the top-left (TL), top-right (TR), bottom-left (BL), and bottom-right (BR) sections. When I compare TL and TR, I find that TR is a 90-degree clockwise rotation of TL. \n\nNext, I look at BL and confirm it's a 270-degree clockwise rotation of TL, matching perfectly. I establish that the final output, following the transformations of TL, is a grid that matches the expected format: \n\n242\n223\n292 \n\nThis confirms my calculations!",
