For example, if I decrease rows and columns, would the output shape match a bounding box of a pattern from the input, possibly focusing on zeros or borders? It seems I could create a count of specific tokens for each row, like in an example where the input has zeros and 4s. The 4s seem to form a border around the zeros which actually create a vertical line. Interesting patterns are emerging!**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing an output containing all zeros across six rows and two columns, which directly matches the input's structure. In another example with values 8 and 3, the 3s appear in rows 2 and 3. The output is 4 rows, 2 columns of 3s, reflecting the height of the 3 region. \n\nNow, I wonder if it's related to counting occurrences of each number. The output perhaps represents filling a grid based on the minority color. It seems they detect patterns that influence the final result. I'm still figuring out how these elements interact!**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI'm considering an alternate approach for determining output patterns. I noticed I could count missing cells in shapes, like in an example where a 2x2 square was almost complete. \n\nI think that the rule could be to identify the minority color and find its bounding box, then create a scaled grid from that region by doubling dimensions. For instance, in a prior example, zeros formed a bounding box shaped like a 3x1 rectangle, which scaled perfectly to fill a larger output grid. It looks like this method consistently applies across examples, but I'll want to see if other factors come into play as well.**Counting and scaling colors**\n\nI'm analyzing a 7x6 grid filled with digits 2 and 0. After counting, I found the total of 0s to be 4 across various rows. The bounding rectangle for the zeros spans rows 3 to 5 and columns 5 to 6, giving me a 3x2 subgrid to work with.\n\nNext, I\u2019ll upscale this subgrid by a factor of 2. Each cell becomes a 2x2 block, resulting in a 6x4 output grid. So, the final output is structured as follows: \n\n2200  \n2200  \n0022  \n0022  \n0000  \n0000  \n\nThis matches my predicted pattern!",
