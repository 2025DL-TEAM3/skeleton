The first example is an 8x8 grid, producing an output of \"11\" and \"15,\" suggesting a 2x2 format for the output. The next input is a 10x10 grid, which gives a 2-row output of \"131\" and \"111,\" indicating a size of 3 columns. Similarly, the third output shows \"88\" and \"18,\" confirming the varied dimensions of the outputs. It\u2019s fascinating how the grid sizes differ across examples!**Examining digit patterns**\n\nLooking at the input examples, I see that the grids have large areas filled with the same digit, mixed in with smaller distinct digits like ones and fives. It seems the output summarizes counts or coordinates of these patterns. For the first example, most of the grid contains 7s, while the distinctive digits are 1s and 5s. I suspect the output conveys the counts or bounding box dimensions of these smaller patterns. \n\nAfter counting the 1s, I find that there are six in total across rows. This breakdown clarifies the extraction process!**Identifying rectangle clusters**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing clusters in a grid and determining if they form rectangles. For the examples, cluster1 and cluster2 are rectangles, with colors sorted to identify which has fewer higher digits for selection. In the test input, I notice a single contiguous cluster of non-zero digits from rows 4-6 and columns 2-4, forming a rectangular shape. This cluster outputs a pattern of 111, 155, and 151, confirming it's rectangular. The final output accurately reflects this 3x3 grid.",
