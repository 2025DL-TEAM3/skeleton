The goal is to maintain the same shape: 10 rows of 6-digit strings for both input and output.\n\nI noticed in the examples that the output grid retains the structure of the input grid, so I need to discover the transformation rules between corresponding elements. Figuring out how the outputs relate to the inputs is key to solving this.**Identifying digit transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the examples provided to better understand the transformation rules for the input rows. In each row, it seems that certain digits, particularly '2', '4', and '8', get changed to '5', while those that are the majority stay the same. \n\nFor instance, in the first example, input rows that include '2's lead to an output of all '5's. It appears I need to identify the majority digits and apply a transformation to the others. I'll keep examining this pattern in the subsequent examples!",
