    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the puzzle transformation**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a matrix of digits that transforms into outputs, so let's break down the first example. The input is an 8x4 grid with each row containing 4 digits, matching the same output dimensions. I\u2019ll start aligning inputs and their corresponding outputs row by row: \n\n- For instance, the first input row \"1199\" becomes \"8888.\" \n\nI\u2019m trying to identify a mapping between these digits, as it seems the transformation involves switching digits to others like 8, 1, or 5. I'll work on compiling those mapping tables for a clearer understanding!**Tabulating transformation rules**\n\nI\u2019m organizing the digit transformations row by row. For instance:\n\n- Row 1: \"1 1 9 9\" transforms to \"8 8 8 8.\"\n- Row 4: \"6 1 9 9\" converts to \"8 1 9 8.\" \n\nHere, the third position shows that 9 can lead to different outputs depending on the row. It seems like certain digits remain unchanged\u2014like 1, 4, and 5\u2014while others convert to 8. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if the pattern might come from some kind of bounding shape or a color coding system. I need to visualize it better!**Finalizing the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m calculating the outputs for each row of the grid systematically. For example, Row 3 transforms \"999991991\" into \"899991998\" by adjusting the edges while keeping the interior intact. Row 4 \"199999999\" also transforms to \"899999998\" with similar logic. \n\nRow 5, as the border, simplifies to \"888888888.\" After double-checking the transformations for accuracy, I can present the final output grid:\n\n```\n888888888\n899999298\n899991998\n899999998\n888888888\n```\n\nI think I\u2019ve covered everything!",
