    "reasoning": "**Analyzing number mapping**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a puzzle that involves mapping input numbers to output digits through an unknown rule. From the examples, it seems each input digit changes to 5, 3, or 7, with the outputs mainly composed of 5s and 3s. For instance, 9 and 6 both map to 5, while 1 maps to 5 and 3 remains unchanged. It appears that 4 also turns into 5. The consistent pattern suggests 3 maps to itself, and all other digits convert to 5.**Exploring mapping rules**\n\nI\u2019m uncovering a fascinating mapping puzzle where certain digits transform based on patterns in prior examples. It appears that \"1\" stays the same, while others, like \"7\" maps to \"5.\" I see through analyzing inputs that \"3\" is consistent in mapping to itself, while the others go to \"5.\" The challenge lies in identifying a \"special digit\" that often appears most frequently, similar to how \"3,\" \"7,\" and \"1\" were in previous examples. I'll consider how those patterns apply to a new grid with digits 2, 3, and 9.**Determining the output grid**\n\nI'm figuring out how to identify a \"special digit\" in the grid. It seems like the digit in the center or the most frequent number could qualify. In my grid, 3 appears to be the most common, so it makes sense to keep 3s and replace other digits with 5s. I've mapped out the transformed output grid based on these observations, maintaining 3 while changing other digits. The final output results in a consistent pattern across each row, reflecting this mapping strategy clearly.",
