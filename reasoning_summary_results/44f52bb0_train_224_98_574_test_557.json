    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid outputs**\n\nI'm considering how each input grid leads to a specific output grid, which for these examples are essentially just single digits in 1x1 grids. I see that example 1 yields '7' from an 8x4 grid, while example 2 produces a '1' from an 8x5 grid, and example 3 again gives '7' from a 10x10 grid. I wonder if the output relates to counting a feature or some property of the grid itself, particularly for the test output of a 4x10 grid.**Interpreting example grids**\n\nLooking at example 1, the grid represents a digit, which is '7'. I'm rewriting the input into rows for better clarity. Example 2 shows a symmetric grid yielding the output '1', while example 3, with more varied digits, outputs '7' again. It seems like I'm identifying symmetry or shapes that resemble digits, possibly as seen on a calculator. For example 1, zeros and nines create boundaries for a shape, suggesting a '7' might be formed. The foot serifs and vertical structure in example 2 point to '1'.",
