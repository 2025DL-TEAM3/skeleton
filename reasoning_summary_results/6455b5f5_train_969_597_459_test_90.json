In the input grid, the only row with all sevens is row 6. For the rows above it, I'll replace zeros: with 8 for row 1 and 1 for the others. Each row's non-seven digits gets altered according to this mapping. I want to ensure I capture the right positions and subtract correctly while retaining the sevens. Let\u2019s align the inputs and outputs carefully to ensure accuracy.**Exploring digit transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to transform the input digits around the special dividing row of all sevens. For positions in the rows above, most sixes are changed to ones, except at position 5 of row 1, where I see it became an eight. I wonder if this change indicates something special about the position. In the row below, the last cell also changed from six to eight. This might suggest a mirroring effect around the dividing row, possibly marking significant positions in the grid. I\u2019ll keep examining these transformations for patterns.**Analyzing training examples**\n\nI'm examining the transformation rules for digits based on designated rows. The special row in example 3 is one filled with sevens, and outputs above and below are changing in specific ways. It seems each row above is modified according to surrounding numbers, while sometimes rows remain unchanged. I'm particularly noting how certain positions, like the third column, change from five to eight or from five to one. \n\nAdditionally, there\u2019s a pattern where filling above and below regions with different numbers corresponds to a larger structure. I need to establish a clear rule for all examples to determine the contiguous filled regions and endpoint markings.",
