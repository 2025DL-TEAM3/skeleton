    "reasoning": "**Understanding ARC Puzzles**\n\nI\u2019m diving into this ARC puzzle, where I can see example pairs that show a transformation process. My goal is to identify the underlying rule and then apply it to a new set of inputs. \n\nThe first example includes transformations based on certain inputs, while the second shows a 9x10 grid of numbers, which also transforms into a new grid pattern. The third example is another grid, suggesting a mapping of the original numbers to new ones. I'll clarify these structures to simplify understanding.**Analyzing Grid Patterns**\n\nI'm examining this grid puzzle, where I have some rows with numbers and I need to figure out a mapping to the output. The first grid is 5x7, and I see specific positions that feature non-4 patterns\u2014those are corners of a block, specifically at (1,1), (1,5), (5,1), and (5,5). \n\nThe output values at these positions change but imply some transformation occurs across the grid. I\u2019m considering if this relates to a rotation or another adjustment based on number proximity. Understanding how I can rotate or map these is my next step!**Deciphering Output Transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing how numbers in a grid transform based on their positions. For example, some positions like (2,3) and (2,5) aren't on the diagonals, yet seem to have special output values. This leads me to suspect a specific pattern governs how these cells relate. \n\nBased on non-background values, I need to define a rectangle that captures the relevant entries, which might extend across the grid. While exploring diagonal influences, I'm wondering if transformations extend beyond the rectangle as well, reflecting a broader pattern. It appears I should consider the full grid dimensions and their impact on the diagonal patterns observed.**Analyzing Grid Fill Logic**\n\nI'm figuring out how to determine filling regions in a grid based on width and height. If the width is even, that means I have to fill based on specific rules regarding columns and alternation of patterns. For example, if I have a width of 5, I determine which columns are filled with color. \n\nI've realized that midpoints come into play when deciding how to fill edges, especially for even dimensions. The fill seems to only occur at these specific midpoints. As I check various dimensions and positions, my observations about symmetry and patterns confirm that the fill regions follow a consistent logic.**Clarifying Border Replication Logic**\n\nI'm working through how to manage border replication for a grid. The idea is that the right border should mirror the interior columns based on their values. For instance, if I have input width of 6, I need to ensure that the border columns correctly replicate values from the designated interior column.\n\nAs I adjust values in specific rows, I realize some rows need to remain unchanged, especially at the edges. So for rows in the middle of the grid, I\u2019ll set the right border to equal the corresponding interior column's values while keeping edge rows intact. I end up with a complete output grid that reflects these adjustments.",
