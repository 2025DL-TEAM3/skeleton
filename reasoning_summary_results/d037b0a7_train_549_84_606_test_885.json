The input grid has a clear pattern of numbers, and the output seems slightly altered in some rows. For instance, the first row stays the same, but there are modifications in the second row, where some digits changed. I need to detail these transformations further, focusing on how specific changes affect the overall grid layout. I'm eager to unravel the exact rule behind these changes!**Deciphering the digit transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the input grids and their output transformations. For the first few rows, I've noticed specific changes\u2014like a digit changing from 6 to 0 or 3 in certain columns. The last row seems to feature a unique permutation of digits from 0 to 8. This bottom row version appears to represent a mapping for each column. I think the other rows build up cumulatively to this, while keeping the matching input values where needed. Each transformation seems linked to this underlying permutation.**Building the output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing the transformations for each column across the rows. For column 3, I have an output of 8 based on earlier calculations. Column 4 outputs 7 from row 4 but remains 5 for the first few rows. Column 5 and 6 stay the same\u2014no changes. For column 7, it becomes 3 after identifying the last non-background value in row 2. When I check each row's input against expected outputs, I can confirm the grid matches the required structure, ensuring everything is in order before presenting the final rows.",
