    "reasoning": "**Analyzing puzzle transformation**\n\nI'm looking at this puzzle, which has three training tasks with inputs and outputs, and I need to figure out the transformation between them.\n\nFor the first example, the input grid contains rows and columns, with most values bordered by zeros. The output, which is a 5x5 grid, reveals non-zero digits extracted from the central area of the input. I see that the input has six rows that are relevant, but only five from those contribute to the output. I think I need to further explore how to derive those specific output rows.**Extracting submatrices**\n\nI'm figuring out how the output relates to the input grid. The relevant area is between rows 1-6 and columns 1-8, giving me a 6x8 section. The output, a 5x5 grid, means I\u2019m selecting specific segments from this section.\n\nEach output row seems connected to corresponding input rows, but there are nuances to solve. For instance, the first output row is \u201c22365,\u201d which I can't connect directly to the complete numbers due to overlapping or duplicate patterns.\n\nI might need to look for unique entries or better ways to prune these selections.**Understanding compression and shapes**\n\nI'm trying to decipher how to select columns for the output and why certain numbers appear. It seems there\u2019s a compression rule for runs of colors based on their lengths. The output rows might be reflecting how many blocks of colors exist, focusing on unique elements and ignoring duplicates.\n\nI believe the task could involve finding color rectangles in the grid, trimming the zero borders, and then counting the width of each colored block for output. This might align with run-length encoding principles, simplifying the presentation of these shapes.",
