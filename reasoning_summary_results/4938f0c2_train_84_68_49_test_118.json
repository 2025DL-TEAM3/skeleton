    "reasoning": "**Analyzing zero patterns**\n\nI\u2019m noticing a pattern with the zeros in the output. For example, the first and fourth rows have zeros in the first column, which suggests a change there from 8 to 0. The zeros might be arranged to mirror around a central shape, creating a column of zeros on the left side. In the input, there\u2019s a zero block in the fourth row, but more zeros appear in the output. It's interesting to see how these adjustments enhance the structure!**Examining the transformation pattern**\n\nThe 2's are shifting right by 2 and 4 positions, which is intriguing! The output for row 4 shows new 2's in columns 2 and 4, indicating they mirrored their original positions from columns 7 and 9 relative to the block's center. The block spans columns 5 and 6, with a symmetry axis at 5.5. I\u2019m noticing a pattern where positions across horizontal and vertical axes are reflected, keeping original values intact, which continues in row 7 as well. It seems like the transformation reflects any colored cells across a defined central block.**Clarifying the grid and outputs**\n\nOkay, I'm trying to make sense of the grid structure. We have 10 rows and 9 columns, which is a bit odd since the first two examples were 10x10. I see that row 6 has a block of 7's in columns 3 and 4. The output shows that these 7's were mirrored across both axes, and I also note some zeros positioned around them, likely forming an L shape. \n\nI'll recount the rows in the output to confirm they indeed match the 10 rows of input\u2014turns out they do! It's fascinating how they mirrored the positions while adding zeros above and beside the block. Now I can analyze the coordinates of those zeros and see how they reflect across the vertical axis to understand their placement fully.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m assembling the grid now! For column values, I\u2019ve identified them as 6, 8, and 4, leading to the string \"686686666\" for row 1. Row 2 and row 3 are similarly constructed with \"684486666.\" I see that rows 1 and 4 both turn out to be \"686686666,\" while rows 2 and 3 are equal as well. The remaining rows (5 to 9) are all \"666666666.\" \n\nIt seems everything matches up nicely! My final output, ensuring the format stays consistent with 9 digits per line, looks like this:\n\n666666666  \n686686666  \n684486666  \n684486666  \n686686666  \n666666666  \n666666666  \n666666666  \n666666666  \n666666666",
