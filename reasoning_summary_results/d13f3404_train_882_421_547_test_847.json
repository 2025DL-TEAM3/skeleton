    "reasoning": "**Analyzing non-uniform rows**\n\nI'm checking for non-uniform rows. Row 1 (5222) is non-uniform, row 2 (2222) is uniform, row 3 (2722) is also non-uniform, and row 4 (5222) again is non-uniform. This gives us three non-uniform rows: 5222, 2722, and, since 5222 repeats, we have 5222 and 2722 as distinct patterns. \n\nNext, I consider the cyclic rotations for row 5222, which are 5222, 2225, 2252, and 2522. I\u2019m organizing these rotations in relation to their positions in the output rows to ensure clarity.**Exploring row patterns**\n\nI'm trying to understand the rotations for row B, which is 2722. The rotations I thought of aren't quite right, and I'm realizing I might need to consider a diagonal shift for the grid rows. \n\nIt could be that both examples are actually shifting entire columns and rows, as if wrapping the input grid. For the first example, it seems like they're doubling dimensions, leading to more unique translations. There's also the realization that interesting rows contain more than one color, while others are uniform. I want to clarify what that means for outputs.**Investigating row and column patterns**\n\nI\u2019m examining how the non-uniform row might be aligned into different quadrants. I realize I should focus on uniform pixel colors across rows instead. Each row presents a majority color, which can define new patterns. \n\nLooking at various examples, I see that the transformation could be simpler, focusing on how uniform colors fill in gaps while keeping distinctive shapes in one quadrant. It seems the patterns may slide along the output, and I'm re-evaluating how to identify unique rows and columns that define these patterns more clearly.",
