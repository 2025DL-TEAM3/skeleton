In the first example, certain digits are replaced with the number 5. It seems like the digit 7 is consistently being changed to 5 across various lines. For instance, in the first input line, the '7' turns into a '5', and this pattern repeats in the other lines as well. This leads me to consider how the transformation rules work for the entire grid.**Defining transformation rules**\n\nIt looks like the rule for this puzzle is to replace every occurrence of '7' with '5'. Okay, so I was checking the second example and noticed that some inputs didn\u2019t have '7' at all, making their outputs unchanged. However, in other cases, such as transforming '13717,' both '7's changed to '5's.\n\nSo now I\u2019m analyzing the new input grid of numbers, applying the rule consistently to replace all '7's. After processing each row, I can confirm that the final output grid accurately reflects all '7's replaced with '5's.",
