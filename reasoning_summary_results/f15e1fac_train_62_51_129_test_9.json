    "reasoning": "**Analyzing row changes**\n\nI\u2019m noticing a pattern in how row changes are triggered, especially with a '5' affecting both the next two rows. Why two rows? It might relate to the sequence's width. For instance, in my examples, both rows 3 and 4 initially feature '9's. Changes seem to kick in starting from row 3, which originally has a '9' that gets altered. In another example, row 3 has a '4' in column 6, aligning with where changes occur only in row 4. It makes me think carefully about how many rows change based on these markers.**Exploring row transformations**\n\nIn example two, I see rows 3 and 6 both have '5's. It\u2019s interesting how each '5' leads to changes in the next two rows. The idea might be that each marker's column index determines how many following rows are altered. For instance, there's a '4' in row 3 at column 6, which would typically imply changes across six rows. But there's only row 4 available. \n\nI\u2019m realizing that various cases show a pattern of colors \u2014 regular digits and special digits that emerge and trigger transformations. It's a little confusing, but each \u201cspecial\u201d appears to create blocks of digits in subsequent rows. It\u2019s definitely worth noting that these blocks can appear centered around different column positions in the examples.**Aligning the examples**\n\nIn example three, I observe that rows 1 and 2 remain unchanged, while rows 3 and 4 are modifications. It's interesting how changes affect rows 3 to 6. In example one, a marker appears in row 3, but only row 4 transforms, leading me to think that rows with markers may not modify themselves. \n\nMaybe the rule is that the distance between markers determines how many rows change. For example, when special digits appear, they create wave patterns or blocks in subsequent rows. Each wave starts at a marker and then propagates left while changing widths. It's like a diamond shape that grows and shrinks.",
