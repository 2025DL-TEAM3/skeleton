    "reasoning": "**Analyzing zero shifts**\n\nI\u2019m working through this pattern of zeros and their positions in each row. In the input for row 5, I need to determine where the zeros move as I shift them right. I\u2019m noting which positions the zeros started in and where they end up. I realize I\u2019ve made a mistake in tracking their movements. By checking each input string carefully, I can clarify the output and ensure the shifts are accurate, especially how \u201c8\u201d doesn\u2019t change. So, it's all about precise tracking.**Exploring zero movements**\n\nI\u2019m looking into row 9 and how zeros are positioned at 6, 7, and 8. It seems like zeros stop moving when they would overlap or exit boundaries. They shift to the right unless there's a collision with another zero in the same row. For example, in row 8, if I shifted the zeros, the second one didn\u2019t move due to boundaries. I\u2019m realizing that the zeros are forming diagonal lines across the grid, creating distinctive patterns as they shift, which is quite interesting!**Analyzing zero shapes**\n\nI'm analyzing how zeros move across different rows. It looks like the zeros shift to the right unless they encounter another zero in the same row. I've identified specific coordinates for the zeros in the input shape, and as I add one to each column, I can see how they should ideally move. However, in my output, some zeros aren't appearing where I expected, suggesting boundaries and occlusions are affecting their movement. \n\nIt's becoming clear that while they're meant to shift right, they\u2019re actually being held back by neighboring zeros, especially in the same row. A similar pattern seems to emerge with different shapes, hinting at how they might behave diagonally.",
