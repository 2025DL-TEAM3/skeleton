    "reasoning": "**Exploring shapes with 9s**\n\nI'm looking at how to find and complete shapes formed by 9s in a grid. Firstly, I establish the coordinates for each row, noting the positions of the 9s. For example, Row 3 has three 9s at x positions 4, 6, and 8, while Row 4 has 5 and 8. When I plot these points, it seems like they could form a diagonal shape. I wonder if it resembles a \"2\" shape or \"Z\" shape, with lines connecting back and forth.**Analyzing diagonal shapes**\n\nI'm mapping out coordinates, like (6, 3) and (5, 4), while trying to visualize the final shape. I notice many points cluster around (5, 5), which might suggest multiple diagonal segments forming a more complex shape. With the addition of (6, 7), I realize I need to evaluate patterns and symmetry. Row 6 mimics Row 5, indicating a possible horizontal reflection around Row 5. I start thinking about how these rows reflect each other across a central axis, which seems to inform the overall shape.**Identifying puzzle transformation rules**\n\nI'm analyzing transformation rules for a series of examples, focusing on how patterns reflect along different axes. The test input is a 7x7 grid. Each example follows a transformation rule, primarily reflecting colored points onto lines/axes. I note how Example 1 reflects across a vertical axis, while Example 2 reflects horizontally. For Example 3, reflecting may depend on dimensions; however, it's ambiguous. I consider reflecting both ways if dimensions match but conclude that the goal is to make the entire shape symmetrical by filling in missing pixels.**Determining final shape symmetry**\n\nI am examining how to reflect values in the grid to identify symmetrical patterns. Currently, I see a vertical line of 7s at row 2, row 4, and row 6 at column 4, which creates a horizontal symmetry across row 4. I also notice that previous rows had 6s at certain columns that now align with this reflection rule. Given the previous examples are consistent in reflecting horizontally, I decide to apply that rule and finalize the output grid, ensuring the formatting is correct.",
