In the output, column 1 consistently shows zeros across all rows. This pattern seems to propagate, as output column 3 also has zeros, despite the input showing no zeros there. It looks like row 8 might play a crucial role in influencing where these zeros appear, affecting column values for the entire output.**Mapping zeros and patterns**\n\nI'm noticing that in input row 8, there\u2019s only one zero in column 1, and yet column 3 has zeros across all output rows. This raises questions about where these zeros in the output originate. The output also includes specific occurrences of the number 5 at particular intersections. It seems that these highlight key endpoints\u2014an interesting pattern emerges where zeros create almost parallel vertical lines, while fives mark the L-shaped transitions in the output. I'll have to think more about how these values interact!**Defining zeros and fives**\n\nI\u2019m digging into the input data where each example has a single zero, which seems to influence the output significantly. For each zero, it looks like other cells in those columns are converted to zero as well, while other original values mainly remain as 6 or 7, except for specific fives marking endpoints in the first and last rows. I see a pattern where fives are positioned adjacent to these zero columns, outlining a structure that visually connects the inputs to the borders. It appears that fives emerge in alternating columns as well!",
