    "reasoning": "**Investigating Color Mapping**\n\nI'm analyzing a mapping from inputs to outputs based on given examples. It looks like there are patterns where colors change based on position, specifically noting how 3 sometimes turns into 2 in row 8\u2019s output. I'm also considering whether the output reflects a majority color from the row or if it fills based on contiguous blocks of numbers. There seem to be clusters of 3s and 7s that could be influencing how colors are assigned. I\u2019ll keep examining the overall pattern!**Analyzing Color Replacements**\n\nI\u2019m exploring how certain numbers might represent background versus objects in the data. For instance, in row 1, all 7s were replaced by 3s, suggesting they\u2019ve removed what could be the background. However, in row 8, the pattern seems inconsistent, with some 3s turning to 2s while others remain unchanged. I\u2019m trying to make sense of how these replacements work. In row 7, the presence of non-2s is preserved, hinting at a potential rule about keeping smaller unique digits. I\u2019ll keep digging for patterns!**Exploring Color Conversions**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how zeros are replaced by the most frequent non-zero color in the grid. This seems to mean that background colors, often zeros, become the majority color of the other objects, while unique colors are preserved. For instance, in the first training scenario, 3 appears to be the most frequent, marking it as the background. However, only certain numbers are replaced in the outputs, keeping rare colors like 1 intact and sometimes preserving odd-numbered colors like 3. I\u2019m intrigued by the patterns that are emerging across trainings!",
