    "reasoning": "**Mapping coordinates**\n\nI'm working on mapping coordinates in a grid where zeros are the base. So for input values of 5 at (3,3) and (6,5), the output indicates where to place the 5s across different rows and columns. Upon reviewing, it seems that these plotted points connect the two special positions, forming a path. Specifically, they connect using what's called \"king's moves,\" which include diagonal and straight steps. I\u2019m also considering calculating the Manhattan distance to check the path length.**Analyzing patterns with coordinates**\n\nI'm looking at whether the 5s create symmetry along the line connecting special points in my input. The output shows two diagonal lines filled with 5s, which unite around the center of the grid. It appears they form a chessboard pattern, filling regions from the corners toward the center. I'm considering how they connect and exploring how I might code this in relation to triangular areas created by certain conditions. It might help to visualize how these values expand outward in a diagonal manner.**Finalizing the grid output**\n\nI've confirmed the coverage is correct. Now, I\u2019ll present the final grid with each row listed in digit format. I checked all the rows for consistency, and everything looks good. In row calculations, the transformations aligned with the original inputs, and no cell repeats were found. It\u2019s important to ensure that the original special values remain in their respective positions, and they do! So, the final output will show the 9x6 grid without any issues.
