    "reasoning": "**Clarifying color replacement rules**\n\nI'm observing that there are specific replacement rules for certain numbers in the input. For instance, in Row 2, all 5s are replaced with 2s, resulting in the output of 6,6,6,6,2,2,2,6,6. Also, for Row 6, the 3s become 1s. Other rows without 3s or 5s remain unchanged. \n\nIt's clear there are two colors defined by these replacements. In the second example, multiple 3s are replaced by 2s as well. The need for mapping is crucial to understand the rule consistency.**Analyzing pixel shapes**\n\nI'm reviewing the shapes formed by 3s and 5s in the examples. In example 1, the 3s create a 2x3 rectangle, totaling 6 cells, and are replaced with color 1. The 5s also form a 2x3 shape, replaced with color 2. \n\nFor the 3s, particularly in rows 4 and 5, they create a T-shape with 8 cells. It seems like there's a consistent mapping where the old color is transformed based on its neighbor count or shape size. Similar patterns appear for the second example, where the shapes continue to be replaced consistently.**Understanding shape mapping**\n\nI'm analyzing the replacement rules for colors based on shape sizes in examples. In example 3, it looks like the shapes of color 7 were replaced with 2, while colors 2 and 1 remained unchanged. Each shape\u2019s size seems to dictate its new color: smaller shapes get 1, and larger shapes get 2, while the background color is preserved.\n\nFor instance, in example 3, the shapes' sizes range from 3 to 6, with the mapping consistently aligning smaller sizes to 1 and larger to 2. This approach maintains coherence across the examples, confirming the mapping rules guide the transformation.**Compiling output grid**\n\nI'm reviewing the transformations from input to output for each row. For example, Row 1 translates to \"5225555225\" and Row 2 to \"2225555255.\" I notice some adjustments in Row 3, ensuring the original columns are correctly reflected after replacements. \n\nRow 4 consistently leads to \"5255555555,\" while Row 5 shows \"5555522555.\" This careful analysis of each column ensures all output values are accurate. The final grid reflects all transformations correctly, matching the desired output perfectly.",
