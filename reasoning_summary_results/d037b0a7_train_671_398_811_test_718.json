    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle transformations**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle where I need to understand the rule from given input-output pairs. The transformation seems to fill columns with specific digits. For instance, in the first sample, the input has a '2' at position (3, 4) while all other cells are '1'. In the output, that '2' remains in place, and then it fills downward into rows below it. The rows above stay unchanged, which suggests a vertical filling pattern from the non-'1' value downwards.**Examining sample input-output**\n\nIn this second sample, the grid has several non-background numbers: '2' at (2,1) and '5' at (3,2). The output indicates that the '2' propagates downward from row 2 to rows 3 and 4, while the '5' appears on both rows 3 and 4 as well. \n\nThe propagation seems to fill downward until another non-background cell is encountered. So for each colored cell, we see the transformation vertically filling its respective column, revealing a consistent pattern of downward propagation within the grid.**Determining propagation rules**\n\nSo, the rule here is to propagate any color that isn't the background downward in its column until the bottom of the grid. In the third sample, I see non-background colors like '5', '6', '0', and '7' at various positions. As I analyze the rows, I can identify how these values fill the cells below them.\n\nBackground color appears to be '2', and I need to list all non-2 digits to see their sources. For example, (5,2) has a non-background '0', while (7,1) shows '6'. I'll keep working through these rules to ensure all non-background colors fill their respective columns correctly.",
