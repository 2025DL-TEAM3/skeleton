However, the output shows just a single center row of 4s in a 3x3 format. It seems like one row of 4 was removed from the top and bottom, as well as one column from one side. So maybe they filter the pattern to highlight only the central repeating motif? The interior rows from 2 to 6 are identical, all being '9944999' repeated.**Decoding output patterns**\n\nIt seems like only one copy is needed from the five rows, and they took the first, middle, and last. The input has an outer border of 9s and identical rows of 9944999 in between. By collapsing repeated rows into unique ones, we get two patterns: '9999999' and '9944999'. The output displays three unique rows: '999', '949', '999'. The '949' comes from compressing the 9944999 using a run-length encoding approach, while the '9999999' is translated to a single '9' for the output middle row.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the columns to identify patterns in the input. Column 1 and 6 have the same pattern (all 3s), while columns 2, 3, and 5 show a different pattern, and column 4 has yet another. After grouping the contiguous columns, I see there are five groups. Then I choose representative rows and columns for output, which results in a 5x5 grid. \n\nThe final output shows the grouped rows: \n\n33333  \n35553  \n35053  \n35553  \n33333  \n\nI\u2019ll present it in this format as requested.",
