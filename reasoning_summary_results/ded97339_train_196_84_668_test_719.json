The first example includes specific inputs with five rows and nine columns, and I need to figure out the changes between the inputs and outputs. \n\nWhen I analyze the first row, it remains unchanged, but for the second row, the output suggests it should be \"222222022,\" highlighting differences in the last three digits. The positions changed from all twos to a mix of two, zero, and two. I need to clarify more details for a complete understanding!**Investigating cluster patterns**\n\nIn the third row, the input shows a 2 followed by a 0, while the output changes some 2s to 0s, specifically at position 7. The changes primarily occur in rows 2 and 3, suggesting there might be a pattern at play. Looking closely, I can see there's a cluster of zeros that might form an \"L\" shape. \n\nThe clusters of zeros in the input are at specific positions, but the output appears to propagate these zeros. I wonder if the arrangement displays a form of connectivity among the clusters. Further analysis might help clarify!**Exploring filling rules in puzzle grid**\n\nI notice specific patterns and rules in how segments are filled in the grid based on the digits present. For instance, if a row or column features two or more marks of a specific digit, the cells in between them get filled as well. This concept applies to all non-background digits, like zeros or special digits, where they create filled segments.\n\nLooking at the examples, it's clear how they keep certain marks as backgrounds, only filling segments for others. Each color's propagation appears to follow a clear rule: fill between positions marked by significant digits, avoiding background numbers. It's intriguing how these patterns form!",
