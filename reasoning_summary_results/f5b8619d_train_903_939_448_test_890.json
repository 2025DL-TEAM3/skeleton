    "reasoning": "**Analyzing pattern transformation**\n\nI'm looking at how each input grid transforms into a larger output pattern. In the first example, the input grid is 4 rows by 5 columns, and it outputs an 8 by 10 grid. It seems that each cell in the input expands into a 2x2 block in the output. The original digits change too, as I see numbers 3 and 7 transform into 3, 7, and 8 in the output blocks. I should check these details further for a clearer understanding.**Identifying output patterns**\n\nI'm examining how inputs transform into output blocks. The first input cell yields a block of '37;37', and when looking at input '7', that produces a block at specific output rows and columns. Interestingly, both inputs seem to generate similar blocks. \n\nI observe that the output grid repeats patterns, specifically rows 0-3 matching rows 4-7, indicating a repeating structure within an 8x10 output. This means blocks may depend on neighboring values, suggesting a more intricate tiling pattern at play.**Decoding output block patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the output rows of example 2, which consist of blocks indexed from 0 to 9. Each input row seems to form corresponding blocks of output, and I'm grouping them into pairs for better understanding. The blocks depend on column positions, producing distinct patterns, possibly alternating based on input values. \n\nNotably, it appears that the output grid is a scaled-up version of the input, using thicker borders to distinguish adjacent cells. The blocks appear to represent the edges between differing input cells, leading to an interesting checkerboard effect.**Computing the output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing an 8x8 output grid based on input pixels. If both the row and column indices are odd, the value comes from the input, otherwise, it's filled with '8'. So, the first row will be all '8's.\n\nWhen I look at odd rows, specific center pixels pull from the input, resulting in a mix of '8's and '0's. I've pinpointed the values, and I notice a pattern emerging, especially reviewing the zeros\u2014these seem to replace original values. \n\nIt's tricky due to the background colors, but I've decided to represent the grid based on my findings. The final output is:\n\n88888888  \n80808080  \n88888888  \n80808580  \n88888888  \n80808180  \n88888888  \n80808080  \n\nThat's my best guess!",
