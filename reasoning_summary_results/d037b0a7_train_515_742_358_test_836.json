    "reasoning": "**Analyzing recorded values**\n\nIn row 2, column 1, an 8 was replaced with 0 because that column recorded a 0, which matches. For column 2, the input value of 4 is new, so it gets recorded, and the output is 4. Similarly, column 3 records 7 and outputs 7. For columns 4-10, the input is an 8 background, and since there's no prior record, it keeps 8 as the default. The rule is to propagate non-background values downwards, updating recorded values for each non-background input, with the common background value serving as a fallback.**Applying recording rules**\n\nIn the second example, the background is 9 with an 8x8 grid. I need to record column values by scanning the rows from top to bottom. For each non-background input at column c, I set recorded[c] to that value. \n\nIn the third example, with a background of 3, I go through each row. For instance, row 2 has non-background values, and I record col5 as 2. Row 4 shows a non-background value of 4 in col4. I continue this for each row, updating the values as necessary while preserving previously recorded values, even for background inputs.**Processing the grid**\n\nI've got an 8x5 grid based on the input, and it looks like the most common background digit is 3. I\u2019ll initialize an empty record for each column. \n\nRows 1 to 4 consist entirely of 3s, yielding the same output for each. In row 5, I encounter a non-background value of 1 in column 3, so I\u2019ll record that. Rows 6 through 8 have some variations, with row 7 introducing an 8 in column 5 and row 8 a 5 in column 2. Fortunately, everything checks out and the final output grid is consistent.",
