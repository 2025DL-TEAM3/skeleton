    "reasoning": "**Evaluating color transformation**\n\nI'm considering whether to replace eliminated colors with the nearest preserved neighbor or fill quadrants with uniform preserved colors. I realized that quadrants are uniform blocks that don't keep the original spatial positions. Instead, they partition a grid around the central row and column, which stay unchanged. For each quadrant, I think it makes sense to fill it with the most frequent preserved non-stripe color from that quadrant. For instance, in the UL quadrant, it appears that 0 has the highest frequency, occurring twice compared to 2.**Analyzing quadrant filling**\n\nI'm concluding that the UL quadrant is filled with 0, based on the preserved non-stripe frequency of 0, which appears thrice compared to 2. However, in the BL quadrant, even though I initially thought it should also be 0, the output shows 2 instead. This inconsistency might arise because they consider row chunks rather than treating quadrants individually. For example, both top quadrants could have been filled using the globally most frequent non-stripe color from the upper half. Meanwhile, the bottom quadrants follow a similar logic, adjusting for their respective halves.**Assessing color filling logic**\n\nI\u2019m thinking that for each quadrant, it makes sense to identify the preserved colors, count their occurrences, and fill the quadrant with the most frequent (local mode). However, in the BL quadrant, I noticed a contradiction: it should choose 0 based on counts, but it actually outputs 2. I'm considering if eliminated colors should also factor in. Maybe they use the corner position of the quadrant to make the selection. \n\nIt's quite complex since it seems like they fill based on color clusters and neighbor proximity, leading to a gradient effect across quadrants. If I look at the flood fill approach, the clusters of 0 dominate, but I'm confused about why certain 2s still remain, given their neighboring positions should ideally preserve occurrences. There\u2019s a lot of nuance here!**Applying test input to grid transformation**\n\nI'm analyzing an input grid to fill quadrants based on preserved colors. The stripe color is consistently 9 in column 3. Counting occurrences, I find 6 appears 9 times, 3 appears 4 times, and 5 is eliminated. So, the quadrants get filled: UR with 3 and the others (UL, BL, and BR) with 6.\n\nI've determined the correct positions for 3 based on Manhattan distances from the center, selecting the one in quadrant UR by reading order. Finally, I construct the output grid, ensuring that all stripes remain in place while filling the quadrants accordingly. The final output grid looks good!",
