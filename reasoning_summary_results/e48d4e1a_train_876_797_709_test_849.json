Double-checking, Row2 is entirely made up of 8\u2019s, confirming the horizontal alignment. I\u2019m also considering how to represent this visually. Based on my findings, I can clearly see that the vertical bar in column 2 across rows one to six consistently holds the value 8.**Examining grid center shifts**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing column 3 across rows and confirming that it consistently holds the value 8. The horizontal line in row 3 also shows all 8\u2019s. For the center, I see a shift from the input\u2019s center at (3,3) to an output center at (2,2), which is different. I need to count vertical bar lengths carefully and establish that the rules for detecting a plus shape involve determining its placement based on integer coordinates. There\u2019s a clear pattern for aligning or shifting positions that I need to clarify further.**Understanding plus shape adjustments**\n\nIn reviewing the examples, I notice that the plus shape is consistently moved as far to one side as the constraints allow. In example 1, the plus isn't at the boundary but instead placed at (4,4), moving away from anomalies. It seems that the unique colored cells are removed and replaced with background colors. For example 2, the odd pixel '6' is absent in the output, confirming that they focus on extracting and centering the plus while keeping its shape symmetric. It looks like they aim for the plus arms to touch the grid sides while avoiding any nearby anomalies.",
