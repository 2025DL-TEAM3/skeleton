The training examples reveal a pattern, particularly focusing on the surrounding frame. In the first example, the original grid has two numbers: 6 and 7, with a certain arrangement. \n\nMy immediate thought is to analyze how these numbers change in the output, while considering whether the outer border is different. I'll label the positions to understand the transformation better. There\u2019s quite a bit to figure out!**Examining grid changes**\n\nIn my analysis of the grid, I see that rows 1, 3-5, and 7 show a pattern, while rows 2 and 6 are filled with 7's. The corners seem to change, indicating a possible alteration in the border. In row 1, the first column switched from 6 to 1, and the last column in row 7 switched from 6 to 3. The interior columns (3-6 in rows 3-5) changed from 6 to 2. I'm curious about what these corner changes could signify and what counts or patterns they might represent!**Analyzing maze patterns**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing a second input example with a grid that features rows of 5's and 0's, suggesting a checkerboard-like pattern. Rows 3 and 5 are all 0's, and columns 1, 3, and 5 contain 5's. In the output, changes occurred in specific positions, which might hint at marking entry and exit points in a maze.\n\nThe changes in the grid indicate isolated clusters of 5's, where only certain cells were altered. This could imply pathways represented by numbers, showing a route through the maze. It seems the walls (7's) enclose corridors (6's), further defining the structure. I need to visualize if there are openings in the walls to allow movement through the maze!**Examining maze structure**\n\nI realize that the interior region forms two blocks in the given grid. The output reveals changes in specific corridor cells, highlighting that one cell was modified in each block. It\u2019s interesting to note that while one block remained the same, the rules might be about identifying unique corridors and marking pathways.\n\nI\u2019m contemplating how walls intersect and whether this could help in defining the maze structure. The idea seems to be finding the corridors linking entrances and exits, while marking the shortest path. I think this requires reassessing how I visualize openings and barriers!",
