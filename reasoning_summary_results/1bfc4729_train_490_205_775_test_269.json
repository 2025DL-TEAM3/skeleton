They show different colors: 6 for row 4, 3 for row 5, and then back to 6. The special column displays a background in non-special rows while the special rows showcase their colors entirely. I see that regions defined by the special color, like the 9 in rows 1 to 3, fill portions, but there\u2019s a contradiction in row 2 having 6s instead of 9s, complicating the shape's expected fill. It feels like there\u2019s a rectangle, but... wait, let\u2019s clarify that.**Visualizing regions in the output**\n\nI\u2019m visualizing the output for an 8x9 grid and identifying the regions defined by the special values. Rows 1-4 create a hollow rectangle defined by 9s as borders, while rows 5-8 create a different one defined by 3s. The area between the special rows shows a pattern: the first rectangle for 9s spans from the top to the special row, and the second for 3s from row 5 downwards.
