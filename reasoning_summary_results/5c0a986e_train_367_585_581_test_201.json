    "reasoning": "**Analyzing color sorting rules**\n\nI'm exploring how to sort colors based on numerical value. For example, in one scenario, smaller values go Northwest (NW) and larger ones Southeast (SE). In an example with colors 1 and 2, 1 is smaller, so it goes NW, and 2 goes SE, which checks out! But I wonder about cases with multiple colors and if color parity plays a role. Maybe even digits should go SE, and odd ones NW. I'll need to confirm if this pattern holds consistently.**Establishing tail rules for blocks**\n\nIn my exploration of the examples, the pattern becomes clear: for each 2x2 block of a non-background color, if the color is even, I extend diagonally from the bottom-right cell; if it\u2019s odd, I start from the top-left cell. I checked example 3 and confirmed this approach: the 1-blocks extend correctly from the top-left cells. For the test input grid, I identify two 2x2 blocks of color 1 and trace their tails correctly toward the grid boundaries.**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI've identified the tail positions for both blocks: Block 1 (starting at (2,3)) has a tail position at (1,2), while Block 2 (beginning at (5,4)) has tail positions at (4,3), (3,2), and (2,1). I\u2019ll mark the positions with 1 in the output grid. Then, I ensure no overlap occurs with existing shapes in the input grid. After updating the relevant positions without double counting, I confirm that the final output grid is:\n\n```\n0100000\n1011000\n0111000\n0010000\n0001100\n0001100\n0000000\n```\nEverything checks out as I review the transitions.",
