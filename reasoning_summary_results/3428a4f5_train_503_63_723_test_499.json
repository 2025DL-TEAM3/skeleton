For the first example, there\u2019s a 9x10 input, and I see specific patterns in the rows, leading me to a 4x10 output representing grouped sections. \n\nI might remove some middle rows while keeping the width intact. For the second example, the 9x3 input has a similar approach with patterns to summarize. I\u2019m curious about counting occurrences of certain colors and how that shapes the output!**Analyzing output conditions**\n\nI\u2019m checking positions for differences in rows and columns, particularly pos6 and pos8, to determine the output values. It seems like the expected differentiations aren\u2019t matching up with my assumptions, leading me to explore alternative pairings, such as comparing adjacent rows. Systematically inspecting each example, I notice colored bands that separate input sections, which could influence the output shape. \n\nIt looks like the output values depend on comparing pixels from these bands, needing careful consideration of how rows interact with one another.",
