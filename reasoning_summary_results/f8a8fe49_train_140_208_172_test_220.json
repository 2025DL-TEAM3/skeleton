    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle patterns**\n\nThis seems to be an ARC puzzle where I need to figure out the relationship between the input and output grids based on the three training examples provided. The first grid shows varied digits, mostly 1s, 3s, and 7s, hinting at a symmetric pattern that is likely modified or reflected. Each example probably follows a unique rule. Observing how each digit transforms in the outputs might help me identify the overall pattern I need to learn. I need to detail my findings further.**Identifying output modifications**\n\nI'm noticing that the output modifies some cells from the outer edges of the input grid. By comparing input1 and output1, I see specific changes, particularly in Rows 0, 4, 5, and 9. For instance, positions (0,1) and (0,2) change from 1s to 3s, while (4,1) and (4,2) switch from 3s to 1s in the output. It appears two small patterns are extracted from the central region, mirrored, and placed at the top and bottom rows, erasing the originals. This indicates a symmetric transformation.**Examining example transformations**\n\nFor the patterns in Row 4 and Row 5, the 3s were relocated vertically to Row 0 and Row 9 while keeping their column positions. In the second example, the 6s from Rows 1 and 2 formed a 2x2 block, which got shifted to both ends of the rows, resulting in new placements at the borders. In the third example, the 9s were similarly removed from the central segment and transformed into zeros in the output. Overall, specific elements are moved while preserving their arrangement within the grid's boundaries.",
