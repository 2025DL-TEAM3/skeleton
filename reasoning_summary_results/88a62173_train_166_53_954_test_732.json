    "reasoning": "**Exploring output rules**\n\nI\u2019m considering if the output digits correspond to the input grid. One thought is to check for missing digits in each column, but that doesn't seem consistent. Maybe I'm looking at the diagonal? But since the grid isn't square, it complicates things. In the first example, the output appears to be simply the first row sorted in descending order. For the second set of rows, that doesn\u2019t hold, so I might need to explore the greatest lexicographic row for further insights.**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI'm looking at the outputs like 9, 8, and 5 and how they relate to the inputs. In another example, the middle row is uniform, leading to an output of 1, possibly representing the most common digit. The third example presents a symmetrical 5x5 grid that outputs a smaller 2x2 grid. It seems like the outputs crop the edges and focus on specific patterns, possibly isolating the shapes formed by certain digits. I'm trying to understand how these shapes correlate to the original input.**Interpreting quadrant selection**\n\nI\u2019m evaluating how zeros cluster in the input grid and what that means for extracting patterns. The zeros form four points around a center dominated by threes and fours. This leads me to think that the output may derive from quadrants, especially the top-left or top-right depending on which has the highest sum. There\u2019s an inconsistency between examples about which quadrant is chosen. I\u2019m contemplating whether the selection might depend on the sums of the quadrants, where the one with the highest sum becomes the output.**Identifying unique quadrants**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a 5x5 grid to determine which quadrant offers unique values. It seems the top-left (TL) quadrant produces the smallest sum compared to others. In previous examples, the selection rule was based on the largest sum or unique patterns, but in the latest case, it turns out the quadrant that is different from the repeating ones should be selected. This method holds for my next test input as well, where the top-right (TR) quadrant shows unique values. That confirms my approach!",
