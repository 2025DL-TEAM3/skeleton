The pattern seems to focus on retaining the first four digits that are not '7' while preserving the order from left to right. For example, from the first row, I scan for non-7 elements, which leads to outputs like 8286 or 8688 depending on the order and distinctness of the digits. I need to ensure the same method is applied systematically across rows.**Clarifying color extraction rules**\n\nI'm trying to decipher the rules for extracting color data from columns. It seems the goal is to remove any column with only '4's, keeping unique color rows. For example, color 2 only appears in row 4, yet it's removed. They do keep rows with colors represented once, like color 0 in row 3 and color 9 in row 5. It looks like they prioritize the most frequent colors while omitting constant rows, which complicates things. I need to keep analyzing how and why rows are selected or discarded.**Examining color shape rules**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to identify and capture shapes in a grid, particularly focusing on contiguous colors. For instance, in one example, I see color 2 forming a line and color 9 appearing in several positions. It seems like the aim is to isolate rows with non-uniform shapes while ignoring solid background rows made up entirely of color 1. They seem to keep representative rows of distinct colors while possibly excluding others like color 2, resulting in some inconsistent outputs. I need to further clarify how the row selection works.",
