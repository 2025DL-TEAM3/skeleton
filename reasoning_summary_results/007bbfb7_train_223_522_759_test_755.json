For the first example, the input is a 3x2 grid, resulting in a 9x4 output grid. The second and third examples indicate scaling a 3x3 input to a 9x9 output, focusing on specific placements in the larger grid. I think I need to clarify how the scaling works, especially for different input dimensions. I want to ensure I understand this transformation accurately.**Clarifying scaling factors**\n\nI\u2019m examining how to apply scale factors for transforming an input grid. The rowScale and colScale relate to the dimensions of the input, so for a 3x2 grid, the output becomes 9 rows and 4 columns. Each cell in the original grid expands into a block that retains its value. However, as I verify the tiling process, I notice a discrepancy. The expected filled values should correspond to the blocks precisely, but the output shows inconsistencies that need addressing. I need to figure this out!**Finalizing output formatting**\n\nI'm working through the specifics of constructing row 3 of the output grid. The calculations for each block are clear\u2014certain columns receive values based on the previous definitions. The resulting row for this stage is \"303000303\". I\u2019m verifying the final output and confirming that each row has 9 digits. After formatting the rows, it looks consistent and aligns with my expectations. I feel good about summarizing the output neatly, with each row represented as a string of digits, separated by newlines.",
