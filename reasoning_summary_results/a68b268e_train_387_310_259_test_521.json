The left region consists of columns 0 and 1, while the right region includes columns 3 and 4, both having 9 rows and 2 columns. I\u2019ve noted the values for each region. Now, I\u2019m wondering about distinct 2x2 blocks and their intersections. I need to investigate overlaps for digit pairs on both sides to see if they form specific shapes. It seems tricky!**Exploring grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether to find rows where left and right pairs aren't symmetric and possibly count transitions. I should inspect the output numbers\u201486, 61, 82, and 06\u2014to identify where they appear. For example, 86 is on the left in row 5 but first appears in row 0. I'll list out the left and right pairs by row and analyze these values further. I\u2019ll look into column pairs and explore if the output relates to distinct colored shapes or clusters in the grid. Finding a pattern here seems complex!**Investigating grid partitions**\n\nI'm analyzing how to count the occurrences of 8s in the left region of a 7x9 grid and checking for any rows or columns with constant digits. In the second example, I notice row 3 is all 3s, which acts as a barrier to split the grid into top and bottom regions. I realize I should consider symmetry between these regions and summarize color frequencies. The output dimensions seem to reduce as I break down the halves, but I need to clarify how those dimensions relate to the original regions!**Assessing output rules**\n\nI'm analyzing the puzzle outputs to determine the rules used for barriers. For example, ex2 seems to modify the barrier method, while ex3 uses a different approach. I\u2019m wondering if a horizontal barrier requires one rule, but when there are both horizontal and vertical barriers, a different rule applies. Ex2 appears to have both types, which complicates things. Ultimately, I suspect the expected output could be the top-left quadrant pattern, but that feels overly simple. It might be better to combine shapes to fill missing parts in the quadrants creatively. I'll propose the bottom-left output as a feasible answer.",
