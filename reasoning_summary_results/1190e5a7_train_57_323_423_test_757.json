So, we have two vertical stripes of 2s, while the alternating stripes create a grid that appears to be 2 rows by 3 columns, filled with zeros. I'm curious why it\u2019s 2x3 and why the values are zeros. It could involve removing the stripes to focus on a \"background\" region with a uniform color. I'm looking for patterns based on this background concept.**Evaluating anomaly rows and colors**\n\nI\u2019m considering whether the width should be based on the number of anomaly rows or stripes. In example 2, I see 2 anomaly rows and a background of 3 rows. So, I conclude the width is 2, while the height of the largest background block is 3, leading to an output of 3x2, which fits.\n\nHowever, in example 1, with only one anomaly row, I\u2019m getting an output of 2x2, which feels off. Perhaps I should explore color frequencies. It looks like there's a majority and minority color at play here, which could clarify the outcomes.**Clarifying dimensions and anomalies**\n\nI'm identifying two minority colors: 2 and 7, but I'm focusing on stripes as anomalies and zero as the background. In example 3, the height corresponds to anomaly columns. Anomaly columns are found in columns 2 and 5, which gives a count of 2. The largest contiguous background block is from rows 1 and 3, with a height of 1. The output dimensions seem to reflect that there are 2 columns of anomalies and 3 rows, which feels off at first. \n\nLooking back, it\u2019s clear that anomalies span all three rows, confirming an anomaly count of 3 rows and 2 columns. This correlates to previous examples with different outputs, challenging me to think about how I define anomalies versus stripes and how they influence the overall dimensions.",
