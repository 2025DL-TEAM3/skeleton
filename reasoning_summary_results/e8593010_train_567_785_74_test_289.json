    "reasoning": "**Sorting cluster labels**\n\nI'm considering how to assign labels to clusters based on their sizes. It seems like the largest cluster should get the smallest label, meaning there's an order where the largest cluster size would have a rank of 1, the next size a rank of 2, and so forth. So, for instance, if a cluster has three cells, it could be labeled as 1, while the two-cell cluster would receive a label of 2, and singletons would be labeled as 3. I'll check an example for further validation.**Identifying clusters of 8**\n\nI'm analyzing connected clusters of 8 based on their positions. In Row0, I see clusters forming like (0,1) and (0,2) as a horizontal connection. Then I notice (0,4) connects vertically through Row1 and Row2, creating another cluster. After mapping out all coordinates, I group them into connected clusters like cluster A with (0,1) and (0,2), cluster B with a vertical line at (0,4)-(2,4), and others. I\u2019m labeling clusters based on their sizes to track them efficiently.**Mapping cluster sizes and ranks**\n\nI'm working on identifying clusters of 8 and assigning ranks based on size. First, I transpose the coordinates of the 8s across the rows and columns, listing their positions. Then I start clustering by checking orthogonal connectivity for each group. For instance, I find clusters A, B, C, etc., based on adjacent 8s. I label their sizes, determine their ranks, and prepare to create an output grid. The background remains 5, while cluster ranks are reflected in their respective positions. Finally, I compile the rows into a final output.",
