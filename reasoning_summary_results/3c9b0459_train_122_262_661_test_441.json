Next, row 6 reverses to 24744, which is row 3's output. Continuing this, row 7 gives 44442, and so on. It looks like all examples match the 180\u00b0 rotation rule: just reversing the order of rows and columns. I'll solidify that as the rule moving forward!**Generating output rows**\n\nI'm going to apply the test input, which has three rows and five columns. For row 1, I reverse row 3 from the input, getting 09222. Row 2 comes from reversing input row 2, resulting in 92220. Finally, row 3 reverses input row 1, resulting in 00020. So the output grid will be: \n\n09222  \n92220  \n00020  \n\nI'll double-check that the reversed inputs match with these outputs. Everything looks good!",
