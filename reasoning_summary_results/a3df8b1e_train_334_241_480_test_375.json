    "reasoning": "**Analyzing diagonal patterns**\n\nI\u2019m working through the pattern here and see they have three repeated diagonals. I start with groups of three columns, noting positions like (3,1), (2,2), and (1,3). I\u2019m trying to identify additional diagonal patterns, but I\u2019m confused about the values in row 1 for each column. For instance, row 1's values appear to influence the structure significantly. Wait, maybe there are only two distinct diagonals instead of three? I need to clarify these positions further.**Mapping diagonal patterns**\n\nI\u2019m identifying positions of 1s in the grid: four in row 2 and clusters in row 3 and row 1. It's clear there's a pattern based on the row and column combinations, particularly when considering parity and positions. So, I notice they\u2019re creating a diagonal stripe pattern with a slope of -1, emanating from a single pixel of color 1 at (3,9). Stripes appear every four columns, extending throughout the grid but stopping before going out of bounds on the top row. This might clarify the design approach!**Exploring diagonal stripe patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the direction of the stripes, which appear to alternate between north-east and north-west orientations. For example, the stripe from (3,1) goes up-right to (2,2), while (3,5) goes to (2,4), which is up-left. I notice an intriguing diamond shape emerging as I assess the layout of 1s across the grid. The pattern radiates in four diagonal directions from the input cell, creating an X-like design. This experimentation yields a unique combination of stripes with various slopes throughout the grid.**Analyzing diagonal stripe patterns**\n\nI'm investigating a new border shape that switches slopes to create patterns. It seems like the seeds at specific grid positions will propagate into diagonal stripes across the grid. For instance, I note that from seeds (1,1) and (1,4), stripes radiate and meet at specific points, filling in with 1s. The periodic nature of these stripes\u2014possibly every four columns\u2014emerges as I look at the interactions and reflections across the grid's vertical and horizontal centers, yielding an intricate design.",
