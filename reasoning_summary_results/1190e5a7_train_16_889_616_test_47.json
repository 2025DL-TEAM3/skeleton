For the second example, I see a grid structure with four rows and five columns. It seems row three has an odd sequence while others have '9'. Column two is consistent with '8's, forming a vertical stripe. Since the overall pattern shows a background of '9' with row three being exceptions, it produces a 2x2 block of '9's. There's something about how I interpret the size calculation as well.**Examining output dimensions**\n\nI realize that regardless of the input dimensions\u2014whether 4, 5, or 6 rows\u2014my output remains consistent at 2 rows and always 2 columns, forming a 2x2 grid. It seems I should focus on the background color of non-odd rows. For example, outputs reflect background colors consistently: '5's in the first example, '9' in the second, and '3' in the third. The key pattern is identifying a constant vertical stripe color and outputting a 2x2 block of the background for the non-odd rows.**Determining output counts**\n\nI'm calculating the output for the grid pattern. In the third example, I see that rows excluding row three include combinations of '3's and a '7'. After counting, I realize there are actually 25 '3's and 6 total '7's across all relevant rows. Since '3' is the most frequent digit, the rule leads me to output '33' in a 2x2 grid. This consistency in finding the most frequent color holds true across all puzzles, making it a reliable approach for determining my output.",
