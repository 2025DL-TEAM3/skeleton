    "reasoning": "**Exploring flood fill logic**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand how the flood fill works here. For instance, (5,6) can\u2019t directly flood down to (6,6) since that\u2019s directly below it. So (6,6) should be filled with 0 before any 1 from (6,5) reaches there. It seems like the rule might prioritize east first, then south, making it complex. I wonder if each non-8 cell can extend right and downward until it hits a border. Each shape's pattern plays a role here, especially with how they interact with 1\u2019s and 8\u2019s.**Analyzing shape extensions**\n\nIt seems like 1 isn\u2019t extending downwards but is extending horizontally to the rightmost border, replacing the background color. For example, it extends to col7, and rows below also show 1 in that column. But for 0, it doesn\u2019t extend vertically since there\u2019s a 1 at row6, col7 instead. I wonder if flood filling could be diagonal, forming rectangles from each cell to its nearest corner. Still, the output shows that these rectangles aren't completely filled, so maybe they stop at anomalies or blockages.**Understanding flood filling process**\n\nIn this example, it looks like the non-background pixels extend horizontally to the rightly border first. For instance, the 5 at (1,3) spreads across to col4,5,6, and then it seems to drop down from col6 to (2,6). Each anomaly acts as a source that fills to the right and then down. The fill seems to overwrite previous values if they share the same column. This suggests that the order of operations plays a big role, as later fills can overwrite earlier ones. Overall, it involves two steps for each new pixel: filling right first and then down.",
