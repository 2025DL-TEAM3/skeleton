    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle transformation**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle that involves mapping grids. The input consists of mostly 3s with some 9s scattered. The output only features 9s and 3s, which makes me wonder about the transformation involved. It seems like it might involve a \"Region flood fill\" or flipping the colors of cells that are nearest to a 9. \n\nThe input has dimensions of 7 columns and 6 rows, and the coordinates of the 9s are key to figuring out the pattern.**Mapping output transformations**\n\nIt looks like there are three '9s' creating a diagonal line at coordinates (2,2), (4,3), and (6,4). Exploring the output, there's a significant presence of '9s' among '3s'. While row1 shows '3s' from column 2 to 4, the segments of '3s' correspond to the input '9s' but seem shifted up. I\u2019m noting the precise coordinates of the '3s' at (1,2), (1,3), (1,4), (3,3), and (5,3). It seems that each '9' in the input generates a line of '3s' above it.**Examining grid transformations**\n\nI'm observing how the grid's transformation occurs with '9' and '3'. For input positions of '9', it seems I generate a length of '3' from the input column, filling horizontally above. This means I mark where '3s' show up, but there are adjustments based on overlaps. \n\nIn examining various examples, I notice that inputs with diagonal markers create outputs filled with those corresponding colors. It looks like the input markers maintain a constant quantity across examples, suggesting a consistent transformation pattern.",
