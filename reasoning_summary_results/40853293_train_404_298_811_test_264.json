So, I should fill row four's columns 1 to 3 with 6. But, wait\u2014row four shows an 8 in column 1. I\u2019m now confused about that. It should be a 6 according to my earlier fill plan, but maybe prior operations changed it, since I filled 8s down before? Something feels off here!**Determining overlapping segments**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the order of overwriting colors in the grid. First, the seeds for 8 fill columns in rows 2 to 9, which overwrites the 6 in row 4. Then, I wonder if filling with 6 in row 4 impacts column 1, which is now 8. Since the segments cross at (4,1), the output shows 8 takes precedence over 6. I conclude that cells fill following the longest or largest segments, accounting for any overlaps too. It\u2019s a complex dance of colors!",
