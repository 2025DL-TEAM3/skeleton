    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input-output grids**\n\nI'm looking at a puzzle that resembles ARC puzzles but with numbers. The inputs are multi-line grids of digits and they seem to be smaller grids. Notably, the first example presents 5 lines with 7 digits, leading to an output of the same number of rows but reduced column lengths. For instance, 7 to 3 columns. In another case, the input to output relation shows a consistent row count, just a smaller column size.**Understanding output patterns**\n\nThe output consists of 3 rows, each with 3 columns, derived from a 7x3 input. This means the row count reduced to 3, while the column count remains constant. Looking at examples, the pattern suggests that 4 columns were removed from the input for the output to form. It appears there\u2019s a rule guiding which columns are kept, likely based on the presence of certain numbers, such as 0 and 3, while others like 4, 9, and 7 do not appear in the output.**Evaluating shape distances**\n\nI'm analyzing how to mark outputs based on the distances from shapes in the input rows. For the first example, I see shapes at specific distances from a center stripe and how these affect the output. The row outputs depend on marking the closest and farthest shapes on each side for each row. Each distance leads to marking specific positions in the output. It's interesting how I\u2019m identifying patterns of selection for these distances, particularly distinguishing between left and right sides, and considering how many shapes to include for accurate output mapping.**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI'm examining a pattern where, depending on the shapes in each row, certain distances are marked in the output. For instance, some rows include shapes that cause exclusion of specific distances. I'm noticing that, while the output must reflect the presence of shapes on either side of a central stripe, all rows in my test input have shapes, which leads to an output of '3' for each row. It seems all rows should indeed return '3', capturing the consistent presence of shapes. I'll ensure I format this output correctly!",
