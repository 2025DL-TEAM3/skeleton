    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid symmetry**\n\nI'm examining a 10x10 grid that's symmetric both horizontally and vertically, and possibly rotationally too. The center is positioned between rows and columns 5 and 6. Each row displays symmetry: Row 1 mirrors Row 10, Row 2 mirrors Row 9, and so on. I've confirmed that Rows 5 and 6 are palindromic, showing 4-way symmetry throughout the grid. This suggests a central region with symmetrical properties, which is quite interesting!**Examining grid patterns**\n\nI'm looking at a grid that shows some rings and seems to feature zeros in certain rows. The outer dimensions are 3x4, which might relate to the anomalies or differences in inputs. Specifically, rows 6, 7, and 8 comprise a block of zeros in columns 4 to 7. I realize this zero block likely needs to be filled with a specific pattern, possibly matching the nested symmetrical patterns found in the training data. The values I\u2019m seeing for output could be 2772, 9229, and 6116, which seem to fit nicely!**Determining grid output**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid where zeros form a specific pattern. It looks like there's only one zero located at (7,5) in the test input. I verified the symmetry by comparing rows, and I found that columns 5 and 6 differ in a couple of rows, indicating zeros. After checking the entire grid, I confirm there's just a single zero. The output, based on mirroring this zero, is the mirrored value at row 4, column 5, which is 6. So, the final answer is: 6.",
