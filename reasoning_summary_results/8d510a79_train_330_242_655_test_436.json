    "reasoning": "**Clarifying cluster propagation**\n\nI'm figuring out how clusters propagate. It seems I only need to propagate the c2 cluster since it has a value of 2, which matches rows 5 and 6. Rows 8 and 9, which show a value of 1, seem to propagate differently. Essentially, clusters of 2 propagate upward, while those of 1 go downward. So, rows 5 and 6 above maintain a pattern of 2, and rows 8 and 9 below maintain a pattern of 1, creating a more refined propagation direction.**Analyzing cluster propagation**\n\nI'm analyzing how cluster values propagate within blocks. For non-default rows, clusters in the upper block go downward, while those in the lower block move upward. For instance, in one example, rows 5, 6, and 7 have clusters that properly propagate upward, but rows 8 and 9 miss out on these clusters. It seems there's something off since rows 5 and 6 only show the value 2 at c2, missing c1 and c3. Cluster values of 2 go upward, while those of 1 go downward, which accurately reflects my findings.**Understanding cluster propagation rules**\n\nI\u2019m dissecting how clusters propagate based on their values around the pivot row. For example, in one case, row 1 has clusters with value 2, and it propagates downward to row 2. However, row 2 has no clusters to propagate downward, so it only receives the value from row 1. I\u2019ve noticed a pattern: clusters with value 2 move downward while those with value 1 move upward toward the pivot. This gives a clear direction for how values flow through the rows surrounding the pivot.**Confirming cluster propagation results**\n\nI\u2019m checking how only the cluster in row 6 with value 2 propagates upward to row 5, leading to certain adjustments in the output. Row 5 transforms based on these values to become 277772777, while row 6 stays the same since it has no downward propagation for value 1. \n\nAfter revising, row 3 also needs correction since it mistakenly showed a cluster. I\u2019ve confirmed that everything now aligns with the correct logic, and my final output grid looks consistent.",
