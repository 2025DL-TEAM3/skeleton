    "reasoning": "**Analyzing puzzle input-output pairs**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a puzzle involving ARCs with input-output pairs presented as grids of digits. Each input line represents a digit in a column of 5 rows. So, if the input is a column with digits like 4, 5, 8, 0, and 5, it results in a grid output of 10 rows and 2 columns. Each row in the output repeats the digit from the input twice, creating pairs like \"44\" for an input of 4. This pattern seems consistent!**Exploring input-output patterns**\n\nNext, for input row 2 with a digit of 5, the output rows will be \"55\" repeated twice. Following that, an 8 becomes \"88,\" a 0 becomes \"00,\" and another 5 turns into \"55.\" Each input digit effectively creates two output rows with two copies of the digit. For example, if the input is a grid like 232, 844, etc., it produces an output that is double in height and width, where each digit forms a 2x2 block. This mapping consistently holds across various inputs!**Expanding input rows into blocks**\n\nEach row of input, like \"9 1\" or \"9 9,\" needs to be transformed into a 2x2 block. For example, the first row, \"9 1,\" expands to \"9911.\" The second row, \"9 9,\" expands to \"9999.\" Each input row translates into two identical output rows, creating an output grid of 8 rows and 4 columns. So, the final output will have these eight rows, each formatted continuously without spaces. I\u2019ll make sure they\u2019re all clearly laid out in separate lines.",
