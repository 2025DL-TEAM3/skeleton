    "reasoning": "**Exploring numeric mappings**\n\nI need to find the underlying rule connecting numeric inputs to output strings. For example, the input \"765\" maps to \"725,\" and \"775\" stays the same. It looks like I might be dealing with transformations for each digit based on their position. Analyzing further, it seems the second digit has a unique transformation, like potentially being affected by parity. I\u2019m curious about mapping with two examples: first digits remain unchanged, while the second shifts. Next, I\u2019ll look at 6-digit numbers to understand better.**Analyzing digit mappings**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how to map input digits to output strings. It seems like every '6' transforms to a '2', while other digits stay the same. For instance, in multiple examples like \"666692\" to \"222292\" or \"670665\" to \"270225,\" I notice that the '6' gets replaced consistently. I\u2019m checking each input, like pairs of digits, to confirm that wherever a '6' appears, it switches to '2.' It looks straightforward now, and I\u2019ll apply this logic to the new test inputs.**Finalizing output mapping**\n\nIn the second chunk, I confirmed that for \"666692\" the mapping is \"222292,\" where '9' and '2' at the end remain unchanged. So, the mapping effectively preserves '2' and '9'. Now, I need to provide the final output grid, ensuring it keeps the original format. The resulting lines are:  \n\n94440  \n88087  \n83223  \n70140  \n21750  \n92224  \n70710  \n\nI think that\u2019s clear and organized!",
