Row 1 doesn\u2019t include a 3 but has four 7s. It seems like there's a game involving colors related to a background color labeled '3.' Each row has a mix of shapes and executes a selection based on the maximum number of 7s, but I\u2019m puzzled about how the output row of 55377 fits into these observations.**Understanding row transformations**\n\nI see that input row 4 has 79397, which doesn't match, and row 5 is 57357, also invalid. It looks like the bottom rows aren't from the input directly but rather derived by modifying the top rows. For example, in ex1, the top row 55255 has four 5s, and the bottom row 00255 has two 5s, indicating a transformation. This involves taking the input row with the highest target digit and creating modified versions, replacing occurrences at the leftmost positions with the smallest non-background digit.**Analyzing digit transformations**\n\nIt seems the process involves adjusting the counts of non-background digits to achieve balance. For input row 2, the dominant digit is 3 with three occurrences, but the output decreases that to two. The other non-background digit, 7, increases to match. It suggests they aim to make counts equal between the two non-background digits. In cases where only one non-background digit exists, like in ex1 and ex2, no equalization is necessary. In ex3, however, they change counts to achieve symmetry, possibly creating a diagonal shape with the most common digits on the left and right.",
