    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit mapping**\n\nI'm looking at this grid puzzle where I need to predict output digits based on input digits. The first three examples involve mapping certain digits to others, like 6 changing to 2, while some digits remain the same. For instance, in the first case, the zeros and sevens stayed unchanged. In the second example, I\u2019m examining an input of 6686606066, which outputs 2282202022. I need to confirm these mappings based on the patterns I see.**Determining digit mappings**\n\nI'm analyzing a digit mapping puzzle where 6 consistently maps to 2. The input examples show: for 61109, the output is 21109, confirming that 6 becomes 2, while all other digits remain unchanged. In the second example, 66099 turns into 22099, again supporting my mapping. I also see in various examples that 8 stays the same while 9 remains unchanged. It looks like my consistent rule here is to replace every '6' with '2' while leaving other digits intact. Now I\u2019ll process the test inputs accordingly!**Summarizing the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m processing a series of rows, mapping specific digits to create the output grid. For example, in Row 1, I get 1 3 4 6 1 1 6, which translates to 1 3 4 2 1 1 2. In Row 3, the input 6 0 2 3 7 0 9 becomes 2 0 2 3 7 0 9. After checking all rows, my completed grid is:\n\n1342112  \n9532281  \n2023709  \n3872222  \n4221117  \n0225255  \n2181257  \n1212827  \n\nEverything seems consistent with my mappings!",
