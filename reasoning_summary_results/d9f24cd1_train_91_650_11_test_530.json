    "reasoning": "**Analyzing flood-fill boundaries**\n\nI'm looking at an L-shaped region of 7s starting from (1,0) and determining how it grows. It expands until it meets barriers like the 6 at (1,3) and the 6 at (6,4). When flood-filling, I realize that it will fill all reachable cells without crossing the 6 barriers. This means it encompasses almost everything except those blocking positions. The fill extends from (1,0) across adjacent zeros but does not extend beyond the defined L region.**Examining flood-fill behavior**\n\nI see that the 6s act as obstacles for filling, even though they seem like they shouldn't block movement. Starting from the 7 at (1,0), I would expect the area to fill completely, but it appears to be limited. The output shows the 7s at specific positions only. Interestingly, while row3 fills from col2 to col8, col0-1 remain zeros despite being theoretically adjacent. It seems the 6s may act as seeds for expansion, directing how 7s fill around them. I need to clearly outline the expansion paths to understand this better.**Understanding fill patterns**\n\nIt seems I misunderstood the filling directions based on the seed's position. In training1, starting from the seed at (1,0), the fill goes right until it meets an obstacle at (1,3), then it turns down. The goal seems to be creating a path that connects edges through obstacles rather than just filling vertically or horizontally. For training2 and training3, the approach varies based on whether the seed is closer to the left or right border, with the filling direction determined by distance to opposing borders. I will test further to confirm this L-shape rule.**Clarifying the fill rules**\n\nIt looks like everything else remains as a background of 3 or 5, resulting in a final grid with 9 rows. The example from training2 is interesting; even with an obstacle at (2,3), it continues filling. This suggests that obstacles may not block progression fully, but instead affect replacements. In training1, the filling stopped unexpectedly before reaching the next obstacle. Given these inconsistencies, I\u2019ll adopt a simpler rule: from the seed color on the border, draw horizontal lines to the nearest boundary, stopping at the first obstacle.",
