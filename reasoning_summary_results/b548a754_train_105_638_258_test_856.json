    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle**\n\nI'm looking at this ARC puzzle, which seems to involve reflecting inner patterns. In the first example, I\u2019m comparing the input and output. The input has distinct shapes, like a '0' that changes to '6' in the output. The rows seem to reflect and replace based on surrounding patterns, especially starting from row three. It looks like the '0' shape is simply in position 2 of row three. That makes me wonder how other rows interact.**Mapping shape rows**\n\nI'm analyzing the shape of a large grid based on color uniformity. In the first example, the top two rows are uniform, while row three includes a '0'. This means the shape might include rows three to six, with rows four to six being the inner section. The output mapping suggests that the rows will reflect previous inputs, which is interesting. In the second example, I see a consistent mapping based on the inputs for shape rows. I'm just trying to ensure everything aligns correctly with the border colors!**Deciphering row mapping**\n\nI'm working through a row mapping that involves shifting and duplicating rows to create a new output shape. The first step involves shifting rows up while duplicating a middle row to fill the output. For example, when I have four rows, the mapping dictates that I drop the first input row, keep the middle rows, and duplicate one to maintain the count. This pattern seems to hold when I check various examples. It suggests that the height of our focus shape often remains consistent at four, leading me to believe this might be some kind of standard.**Validating row mapping**\n\nFor N=4, I\u2019m mapping the rows as follows: row1 becomes S2, row2 becomes S3, and rows 3 and 4 mirror S3. In my test, I see that the first row stays uniform, while the subsequent rows start reflecting interior colors. It's interesting to note that rows 3 and 4 are identical, which raises symmetry questions. The borders also maintain distinct patterns, but I now realize the significance of keeping the bottom row unchanged. After confirming everything fits with the original criteria, I finalize my output, ensuring neatness.",
