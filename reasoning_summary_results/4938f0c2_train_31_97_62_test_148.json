    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation patterns**\n\nI'm looking at a task that involves identifying patterns in transformations between input and output pairs. The pairs consist of two 10x10 grids and one 9x9 grid. In the first pair, I see '2's, '4's, and '0's where some '2's transform into '0's, creating a symmetrical pattern around a central block. I need to clarify how this transformation works for the next input based on these patterns before applying it. Let's keep digging into the remaining examples!**Evaluating ring patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the transformation where I see a shape that expands by 1 on each side, and I need to clarify the configuration of zeros in the rings. The first ring has zeros in a line at specific rows and columns, while the second ring is a hollow rectangle defined by certain endpoints. It's interesting that the vertical edges don't follow the same pattern, remaining filled with '2's. This concentric structure with missing vertical edges creates a unique pattern that I should keep in mind as I progress with this analysis.**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI\u2019ve processed the transformation for each row based on previous patterns. Rows 1 through 5 remain as '888888888'. For row 6, I've filled in the zeros to get '000088888', and row 7 becomes '066088888'. Row 8 matches row 7 and also reads '066088888'. Row 9 has also been transformed to '000088888', while row 10 stays as '888888888'. All rows are counted, and everything aligns with the expected pattern, confirming the final output grid.",
