    "reasoning": "**Analyzing border movement**\n\nI'm figuring out how a border moves to fit within a grid. In examples one and three, the borders shift to the rightmost edge, while in example two, they go down to the bottom edge. I wonder why that is? Perhaps it has to do with the longer dimension of the unoccupied space. For example, in the first one, the border is wider than it is tall, so it moves horizontally. However, even in example three, where it's taller, they still shifted right. I need to rethink that discrepancy.**Examining rectangle movement**\n\nIn example three, I see that the rectangle's border occupies columns 8-9 and moves to the right, but it seems like the width has changed. Initially, I wondered about the movement direction. It appears they always shift the rectangle border toward the nearest grid edge along the shortest path. For instance, in example one, the distance to both the left and right edges was equal. They chose to go right, but why? In ties, maybe horizontal movement takes precedence over vertical? That could explain their consistent rightward choice.**Clarifying interior shapes**\n\nI'm unraveling the complexities of example three's output. It seems the interior shape at row two has changed and is now represented only at column 8. I realize that the interior actually includes the center region of rows two to four and columns six to seven. However, this creates confusion, as I expected the interior to be filled with a different color. So, to simplify, I need to determine the hollow rectangle frame and move that to the nearest edge, while leaving the interior shape unchanged.**Resolving movement conflicts**\n\nIt seems there was no horizontal conflict, but moving vertically might overlap with the top row. I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s purely mathematical rather than about conflicts. In examples, they favor moving horizontally or vertically based on minimal distances. For our case, vertical distance is 2 and horizontal is 4, suggesting a vertical move. However, since zeros are considered part of the frame, I realize that's tricky. I\u2019m leaning towards moving horizontally to avoid potential collisions, so I think the predicted output reflecting that is correct.",
