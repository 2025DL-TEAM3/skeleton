For instance, with input '9', '8', and '0', the output is '99', '88', '00', followed by '00', '88', '99'. It looks like I\u2019m reflecting the digits to create symmetry. Each digit repeats twice, and then I reverse the sequence. The rule seems to involve generating a vertical palindrome from the input column. That\u2019s interesting!**Understanding mirroring rules**\n\nIn this example, with input like '41', '24', '94', and '58', the output is derived by taking each input row, concatenating it with its reverse, and then repeating that in reverse order.\n\nFor instance, '41' becomes '4114', and similarly for the other rows. The pattern holds: for '576' and '226', the output is '576675', '226622', followed by the same rows in reverse. \n\nIf there's a single row, like '11563', it mirrors itself, resulting in the same output twice. So, I see the rule is about creating mirrored rows and doubling them in the output.**Performing digit mirroring**\n\nIn this case, the input consists of single-digit strings: '9', '8', and '0'. For each, I mirror the digit by duplicating it; so '9' becomes '99'. Then, I need to reverse the rows I created. That leads to the final output that maintains the mirrored symmetry in the arrangement. Overall, I see that the process involves creating a simple yet effective reflection of the input digits, confirming the answer!",
