The output seems to be 3 rows by 3 columns, possibly indicating a focus on the central columns 2, 3, and 4. I\u2019ve identified that extracting these columns creates a new structure. However, the output rows don't appear to match any contiguous rows from the original input. I\u2019m trying to remember if I should shift the columns or adjust my approach to get the right match. It's a puzzling situation!**Exploring subgrids**\n\nI'm examining columns 3 to 5 from an input matrix, where the first three rows match the output perfectly. It seems that the output consists of the first three rows of this subgrid. I'm also checking another input matrix to find a matching 3x3 subgrid. After analyzing several rows and columns to find the sequence [1,8,6], it looks like I'm struggling to pinpoint where this appears. I might need to keep searching through the rest of the rows for a match!",
