    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the Symmetric Transformation**\n\nI'm considering a pattern where it seems I'm turning values from 55 to 99, but only focusing on specific rows. From the provided examples, I'm examining how particular digits are being replaced. In the first two rows, the '7' at position 2 changes to '8', while other rows remain unchanged. The same indexing applies consistently, revealing a mirroring or structured method to the changes. Ultimately, I need to confirm the rules that dictate these replacements across all rows.**Examining Row Transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing how pairs of repeated rows are changing based on the way they compare with previous patterns. For example, in the first two rows, a digit is modified, while other rows remain unchanged. I\u2019m noticing a pattern where certain positions change within these repeating blocks, particularly focusing on how 'x', 'y', and 'z' values fluctuate. In my observations, z values seem to be swapped selectively with x values, depending on their position in the rows. I\u2019ll need to clarify which specific pairs are affected and the underlying rules for these changes.**Investigating Row Transformations**\n\nI\u2019m examining how certain rows are being altered based on a specific pattern. For example, it seems that they unify values by modifying minority elements in repeated rows, but I wonder why they only change certain digits and not all of them. In my observations, some positions remain untouched, suggesting they might aim for symmetry. I also see that the output includes unchanged rows, leading me to think they apply transformations selectively, following some underlying template or pattern from earlier blocks. I\u2019ll keep exploring this concept further.",
