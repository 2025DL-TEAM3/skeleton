    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid stamping**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how the inputs correspond to the grid. Row 0 has a mirror image in Row 1, and Row 2 mirrors Row 1 again. It seems they might be drawing horizontal lines, but it\u2019s more about filling a pattern in the output based on the input grid. It feels like there\u2019s a stamping process at three positions: top-left, middle-left, and middle-right. The coordinates for these stamps are (0,0), (3,0), and (3,2). It's an interesting way to visualize the pattern!**Exploring composite stamping**\n\nThey create a 9x4 composite canvas that starts at zero and then overlays input through stamping. I\u2019m looking at how these stamps might overwrite previous values. For example, with the first stamp at (0,0), I see it overlays input from rows 0-2 and columns 0-1. The second stamp follows at (3,0), affecting rows 3-5 and columns 0-1, then the third at (3,2) covers rows 3-5 and columns 2-3. It feels like this matches the expected output perfectly! \n\nFor the second example with height 2 and width 3, there are five stamps: (0,0), (0,3), (0,6), (2,3), and (2,6). The pattern seems to reflect a relation between i and j indices of blocks, possibly influencing how the rows with non-zeros dictate stamp positions. It's intriguing how the triangular input shapes the output through this selective stamping!**Considering stamping transformations**\n\nI\u2019m pondering whether the order of non-zero cells might impact how we stamp. For instance, in a row like 3030, it\u2019s a duplication of input row (1,0). The process of stamping seems tied to where non-zero values are, but I wonder if there\u2019s a transformation involved. \n\nFor the offset stamping, it looks like current procedures could improve by aligning input cells to specific output positions. I\u2019m testing this idea through various examples, but something seems off in how the last stamps are being applied. It suggests they might not be using the full input for all stamps, indicating some transformation at play when overlapping occurs.**Computing output grid**\n\nI'm thinking through the process of stamping zeros and how it shouldn't affect previous data since the stamps are disjoint. Since the blocks created by different stamps are unique, they won\u2019t overlap unless they share the same position. This means that any non-zero input cell directly translates into a specific position in the output.\n\nFor example, with the input grid of:\n\n```\n700\n007\n000\n```\n\nI see non-zero cells at (0,0) and (1,2). So I'll stamp these positions, filling the relevant areas in the output grid. After processing each stamp, the final output will look like this:\n\n```\n700000000\n007000000\n000000000\n000000700\n000000007\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n000000000\n```\n\nIt aligns perfectly with what I expected!",
