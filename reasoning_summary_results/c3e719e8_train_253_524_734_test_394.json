The first input consists of three two-digit strings, leading to a 9x4 grid. I counted the lines, realizing there are 9 lines total, each 4 characters long.\n\nThe second example features two three-digit strings, producing an output of four lines, each 9 characters long made up of zeros and the original numbers. It's interesting to decipher how these patterns are formed!**Structuring output blocks**\n\nI\u2019m trying to break down the output into 3 row-blocks with a height of 3 and 2 column-blocks with a width of 2. The idea is to create a 3x2 block grid, where each block is a submatrix of size 3x2.\n\nSo, the blocks in this grid would align with certain entries of my input. It seems like the output aligns with these configurations, as I can place my input within these blocks. I need to confirm the rows and columns to ensure everything matches correctly!",
