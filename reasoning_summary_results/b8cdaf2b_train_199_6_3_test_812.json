    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle transformations**\n\nI\u2019m examining an ARC puzzle involving grids of digits, where each input consists of 4-5 equal-length rows. The goal is to identify transformations that adjust specific digits in these rows. In the examples, the output shows how only certain rows change while keeping others intact. For instance, in one case, the third row shifts from 7777 to 4774, while the rest remain the same. Each example illustrates a pattern of selective digit adjustment.**Identifying digit transformation patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a grid where it seems symmetrical around the central row. The adjustments include changing digits like 8s to 4s and 7s to 0s, potentially affecting corner positions too. Each grid training features a key row that serves as a pivot\u2014this row stays the same while others modify symmetrically. For example, only one row out of identical rows changes, suggesting that duplicate rows may only shift the first occurrence. This is tied to a pattern of 8s forming an \"X\" shape across the grid.**Exploring color patterns in grids**\n\nI\u2019m examining how digits transform in these grid puzzles, particularly focusing on the way certain colors trigger changes. In example two, there\u2019s an L shape formed by the number 3 in specific columns, while rows with the same digits remain unchanged. Then, the pattern shifts with colors reflecting where adjustments happen. In example three, a vertical stripe of 9s influences changes, but the unique row with a 4 stays untouched. The output shows a strategic approach to tracking positions and reflecting changes vertically and horizontally.**Calculating grid transformations**\n\nI\u2019m working through a grid transformation process where I calculate the distance of each row from specific target values. For each row, I find the minimum distance to either 5 or 6 and then determine the corresponding column to change based on that distance. I replace the appropriate positions with the value 5, ensuring I update the grid accurately. Finally, I compile the modified rows to see the final output, noting the symmetry among certain rows and confirming my changes for consistency.",
