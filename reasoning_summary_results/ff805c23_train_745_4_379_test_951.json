    "reasoning": "**Analyzing symmetry in rows**\n\nI'm testing if rows are symmetrical left to right. Looking at row 2, \"22200022,\" it starts off symmetric, but zeros break that symmetry. For example, positions 1 and 8 have matching values, but positions 3 and 6 don't. I realize that if I fill zeros with mirrored values from the other side, it might restore symmetry. For row 2, zeros at column 4 and 5 have mirrors that are both zero, but filling column 6 with the corresponding value from column 3 could work.**Filling in mirrored values**\n\nI'm working through how to fill in zeros for row 3 and row 2. For row 3, I'm filling column 6 with the mirrored value from column 3, which is 3. Now, for row 2 columns 4 and 5, I\u2019ll check the symmetry by looking at their mirrored counterparts in row 7. I see that both fill with 3. Implementing this mapping, I confirm outputs match, ensuring every zero gets filled correctly based on their mirrored positions across the horizontal axis.**Determining mirror symmetry**\n\nI'm checking rows 5 and 6 for zeros, noticing a pattern only appears there. It seems the critical axis is between rows 5 and 6, indicating the zeros might be below this line. I also explore whether the zeros span a vertical region. By examining columns 2 to 4, I realize the zeros fit only on the left side, suggesting a vertical mirror could work, but they overlap the axis, complicating things. In other examples, I've seen mirrors that allow for filling zeros from the opposite side, so it makes sense to choose the mirror axis that avoids zeros, either horizontal or vertical, ensuring maps to non-zero values.",
