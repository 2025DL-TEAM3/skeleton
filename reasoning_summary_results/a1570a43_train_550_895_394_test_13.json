    "reasoning": "**Exploring bounding rectangles**\n\nI'm looking for the bounding rectangle of non-4s in the provided grid. Non-4s are anything that's not a 4. I notice the min and max column positions of the non-4s. Row analysis shows non-4s in specific columns. Max column ends at 9, and min at 1. While I ponder potential rotations or reflections of the rectangle, I realize it may be more effective to reflect interior rows around their center, especially avoiding border complications.**Clarifying shifting rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how to shift columns and rows in the grid. For example, in the first region, the columns that have non-4s should dictate which way we move things. It seems rows 2-6 shift right, wrapping around, while rows 5-9 in another example move left. In yet another case, it looks like we might shift columns instead of rows because the area is taller than it is wide. I\u2019ll focus on maintaining these rules based on the shapes of the regions.**Understanding shifting rules**\n\nI'm working through rules that might dictate how to handle digit shifts in rows based on their configuration. It seems there\u2019s a central shape formed by non-background pixels, and possibly, these shapes give direction for shifts. In the first example, a right shift correlates with the digit arrangement, while the third example calls for a left shift. Then I noticed variations based on row counts. For the second example, it looks like rows might be shifted vertically, moving them down. It\u2019s complex but intriguing!**Analyzing rotation rules**\n\nI'm dissecting how to interpret rotations based on the puzzles involving arrows formed by non-background pixels. It seems like the direction of shifting can be inferred from these arrows: for instance, if the arrow points left, rows shift left; if it points down, columns shift down. In the current case, I've identified subregions and am determining how to apply these rules based on the arrow shape. It\u2019s intricate but essential for figuring out how they transform the input!",
