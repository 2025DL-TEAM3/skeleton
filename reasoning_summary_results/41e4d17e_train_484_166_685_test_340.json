    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid structure**\n\nI'm noticing that the input consists of a 9 by 7 grid filled with digits. The 4's create a hollow rectangle, primarily within rows 3 to 7 and columns 3 to 7. Notably, row 5 is interesting, as it shows 6646664, while row 4 reads 1141114. The center of the 5x5 rectangle formed by these 4's is at (5,5), which seems important. I wonder if there's something more to highlight or extract about that center point.**Calculating center of rectangles**\n\nLooking at the output for row 5, it creates a horizontal line showing distinct values and a rectangle border. The shape I want to analyze forms a hollow rectangle with uniform color. To find the center, I need to average the row and column positions, specifically rounding as needed. \n\nFor even dimensions, they seem to choose the right or lower central positions. Examples clarify this well, ensuring consistency in how I determine the center coordinates. I\u2019ll calculate using these methods as I go along.**Filling the grid**\n\nI'm working on a grid derived from the input, which has 6 rows and 9 columns. I found a rectangle formed by 8's running through rows 1 to 5 and columns 3 to 7. The challenge is to draw a plus sign at the center coordinates without overwriting the rectangle edges. \n\nI\u2019ll fill the center row and column with color 6 while avoiding 8's which form the rectangle border. This leads to adjusted rows, where I replace non-restricted cells with 6, with careful checks along the way.**Final grid output**\n\nI've confirmed the final grid output after processing. The resulting rows are:  \n1. 118888811  \n2. 118161811  \n3. 668666866  \n4. 118161811  \n5. 118888811  \n6. 111116111  \n\nI've double-checked that the vertical and horizontal lines form a plus sign at the correct coordinates. Rows 2 and 6 were skipped for the vertical at col 5 because they contained border colors. Everything matches, so it looks perfect! I'll go ahead and output those six lines.",
