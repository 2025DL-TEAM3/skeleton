For instance, the first and second rows stayed the same, while the fourth row had a change where a \u201c4\u201d was added in column one. \n\nOn examining the seventh row, they changed some values, likely filling in gaps between existing colors. Overall, it feels like I'm aligning all these rows correctly!**Re-evaluating shapes in example**\n\nLet\u2019s take a closer look at row 4 in Example 2. The input is \u201c666666666,\u201d while the output is \u201c646666666,\u201d which indicates a \u201c4\u201d was inserted at column 1. I\u2019m curious why this happened, given the surrounding rows above and below seem to connect.\n\nThe shape formed by the \u201c4s\u201d across multiple rows suggests that I should consider filling in gaps to create a contiguous shape. The \u201c4s\u201d are scattered in the input, but the output densifies connections. \n\nIt seems there should have been a fill at column 0 instead of column 1 for proper continuity, but they chose column 1!**Reviewing fill rules**\n\nI need to analyze the reasoning behind filling gaps in the grid. For row 5, I initially thought there should be a fill due to vertical alignment of \u201c4s,\u201d but upon closer inspection, I see that there are not two vertical \u201c4s\u201d in the same column\u2014this is key.\n\nLooking at new input, it seems there are two \u201c0s\u201d in column 4, both in rows 2 and 4, so I\u2019ll fill row 3, column 4 with \u201c0.\u201d The final output reflects this adjustment while ensuring no other rows or columns need changes.",
