The rows might correspond to different colors, possibly including a background color represented as zeros. I need to figure out how colors relate to these numbers. The output row, like 333030, probably indicates the presence of shapes covering specific columns. With an input grid of 9x6 leading to 4 output rows, I suspect those rows indicate distinct colors from the input, including background.**Evaluating grid logic**\n\nI\u2019m noticing the input only has values 9, 8, 7, and 0, with a goal to create a 4x6 output grid. It's odd since the input has 7 non-empty rows, while the output only has 4. Perhaps I'm focusing on removing blank rows. I need to think about extracting shape intersections, and it looks like I'm mapping input shapes to output values like 3s and 0s. The second example includes different numbers, showing a binary mask indicating specific pixels, like detecting patterns. It's becoming complex!**Examining color grid dynamics**\n\nLooking at the input grid of 9 rows and 9 columns, I notice distinct patterns. Column 5 has a vertical line of 2's, while columns 6-9 contain different arrangements of 0\u2019s and 9\u2019s. The shapes formed suggest clusters of 9's at the bottom right and squares of 7's in the top left. Since the output consists of 8 rows, it seems that I'm subtracting the number of distinct colored components to determine the output rows. Each distinct shape's count could be influencing the total output, possibly aligning with a thresholding approach. It\u2019s definitely complex!",
