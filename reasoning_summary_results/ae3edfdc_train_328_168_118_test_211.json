I need to trace the colors: we have 1s, 2s, 3s, and 7s. It seems we might be rotating the colored elements somehow.\n\nLooking closely, I note the positions of the 7s and identify shapes based on their coordinates. There are single cells for most 7s, but two are grouped in the last row. The same goes for the other colors, too!**Tracking 7's positions**\n\nI see there's a 1 at r5c3, and I've been examining the 7s. In row4, I notice two 7s at r4c2 and c3, while row5 has only the 1. Row6 shows three 7s at c2, c3, and c4. Seems like the 7s are forming a block between rows 4 and 6.\n\nI count a total of five 7s in the output, while the input initially had six. I need to check my counts again, as something seems off with the output for row5!**Assessing 3s positions**\n\nI'm analyzing the positions of the 3s around a central 2. In the input, there were eight 3s, but the output shows only seven, meaning one 3 is missing. \n\nLooking at specific positions, like (6,3) to (8,5), it's clear some of them shifted left or avoided grid boundaries. The rule seems to be for each 3 to move one step closer to the 2 until they're adjacent. It looks like they might have teleported to the nearest available cell instead of moving stepwise. I'll need to track these movements more closely to understand the clustering better!",
