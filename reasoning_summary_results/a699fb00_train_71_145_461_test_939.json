It looks like in Row 3, the 9s are at (3,3) and (3,5), and in Row 4, they sit at (4,2) and (4,4). So, I've traced them out\u2014it seems they form a diamond shape or maybe a diagonal stripe rather than a traditional square. It's interesting how these points are connected! Now, I'm wondering how to visualize this better.**Analyzing number placements**\n\nI'm examining how the changes in this grid replace certain positions with 2s. These 2s are midpoints between the 9s, which seem to form diagonal connections. For instance, the 2 at (3,4) is sandwiched between 9 at (3,3) and (3,5). It turns out that the rule is whenever two 9s are separated by one cell, that cell becomes a 2. Now, looking at the second input, I see various 1s in a cross-like shape, while the 0s create a defined pattern. It's all quite intriguing!**Formatting the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the rows to ensure everything in the grid is correct. For instance, Row 2 produces 525999, which I\u2019ve double-checked against the input to confirm the gaps and correct values. Row 8 checks out too, with the transformation from 595959 resulting in 525259. I see that the positions in Row 8 align exactly as needed. So, it looks like I've achieved consistency across all rows! Now, I can present the final 10-row grid.",
