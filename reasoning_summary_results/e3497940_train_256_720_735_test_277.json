For instance, from the row \"777707777,\" the first four characters \"7777\" match the output. I notice this pattern continues for other examples too, confirming that the process involves taking the first four columns from each input row.**Finalizing grid output rules**\n\nI've figured out the rule for transforming an input grid, which has rows x 9 columns, into an output grid with the same number of rows but only 4 columns. For the test input of 7 rows and 9 columns, I simply take the first four digits of each row. For instance, row one \"876323888\" gives \"8763.\" After going through all the rows, I confirm that the output grid is correct, with each row consisting of 4 digits.",
