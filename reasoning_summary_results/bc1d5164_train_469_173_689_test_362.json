To visualize, I'll label the rows and columns: rows 0 to 6 and columns 0 to 6. \n\nThe first input represents the grid, showing values across rows. Now, looking at my extracted output, I have a 4-row by 3-column subgrid. I'm trying to identify how these extracted rows, specifically rows 0-3, correspond to the coordinates of the original grid. Let\u2019s figure that out!**Identifying subgrid patterns**\n\nI'm trying to identify the pattern within the subgrid, particularly focusing on the positions containing '4's in the input grid. The coordinates of all the '4's are noted. \n\nThe relevant rows are 0, 1, 2, 4, and 5, while the columns are 0, 1, 5, and 6. It looks like rows 3 and 6 were removed because they're full of '2's. Now, I'm noticing that the output rows correspond to input row positions based on those selected columns. So, the chosen subgrid is at rows 0, 1, 2, and 5, across columns 0, 5, and 6. Let\u2019s figure out why those specific rows and columns were chosen!**Determining output values**\n\nI'm attempting to predict the output values by clustering rows and including columns 0, 5, and 6. For the test input, I'm focusing on rows 0, 1, 2, and possibly row 6 or 5. \n\nAfter examining the values, I calculated the outputs, leading to predictions like 999, 599, and 559 based on the identified patterns. While I suspect my choices may need refining, I\u2019m sticking with this outcome for now since it aligns with cluster criteria. It feels a little like just guessing, but I'm trying to follow the patterns I\u2019ve observed!",
