For instance, the first example starts with a 7x9 input and results in a 4x6 output. The second follows the same pattern with dimensions, leading me to think there's a consistent rule here. It seems like the output involves cropping or selecting a submatrix based on color patterns. The overall structure appears to highlight certain colors while discarding others. Let's piece this together!**Parsing color clusters**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about identifying a cluster of a main color and finding its bounding box, perhaps with some pixel shrinkage or a morphological transformation. Examining the first example in detail shows a 7x9 input grid. The output seems to mostly consist of the main color (7) with a single instance of another (6).\n\nThe core region appears to be filled with 7s, except for specific columns where the numbers differ. I\u2019ll need to map out these regions and find the coordinates of the bounding box for the cluster of color 7. Let's break this down further!**Mapping anomalies to output**\n\nI'm mapping the input indices to their designated output columns. It looks like I'm transforming values based on their positions. The transformation replaces the original anomalies with values from the BL region, where I've determined the mapping to be consistent.\n\nI can see that positions in the output grid match the transformed values correctly. The final output after replacements looks solid: first row has a mix of values after replacing anomalies, while the subsequent rows remain unchanged. I\u2019m confirming everything aligns as intended for the final formatted output.",
