    "reasoning": "**Analyzing diagonal patterns**\n\nI'm exploring a pattern where a diagonal starts at (3,4) with a slope of 1 and a horizontal stride of 2. From this point, 6s spread diagonally. The output reveals an intriguing structure filled with 6s and 2s, especially in certain rows. For instance, Row2 has a 2 at index 1, while Row3 features 2s at indices 1, 4, and 9. I\u2019m comparing these outputs to the original input, focusing on where the 2s appear among the 6s.**Examining patterns with 2s**\n\nIn row 3, there are 2s at indices 1, 4, and 9, which I find interesting since the input didn't have any 6s at these positions. This might indicate a diagonal symmetry or pattern. Moving to the next example, the input has mostly 5s, but in row 3, it shows all 3s, creating a uniform row. \n\nIn another example, I observe special 2s appearing in positions (0,1), (2,3), and (4,5), suggesting they may create a diamond shape in the output. The symmetrical filling gives a unique pattern around these diagonal positions.**Investigating patterns in shapes**\n\nI'm looking at how the special points in the input relate to their positions. It seems that input specials may be midpoints of edges in a diamond shape. For example, in one case, I identify a diagonal of special points across multiple inputs. I also notice there are rows with consistent 2s that potentially form a diamond shape, depending on symmetry and the overall pattern.\n\nIn the new test input, there's a diagonal of special points, showing a similar slope with row and column increments of 1. This all ties back to the concept of lines formed from colored pixels, showing a clear pattern across multiple examples.",
