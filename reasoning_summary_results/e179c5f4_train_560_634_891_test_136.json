    "reasoning": "**Analyzing distance coloring**\n\nI'm considering a coloring approach based on the parity of distance. If the distance mod2 equals 0, it's one color; if 1, another. The idea is to create a checkerboard effect around special points. \n\nFor instance, starting with the points at (0,0) and (9,0), I calculate the Manhattan distance for each cell. At (0,2), the distance to (0,0) should show an even value, giving me a color of 7. Yet, the output indicates 8. It seems there might be an error in reading the columns. I'll need to double-check!**Investigating distance coloring discrepancies**\n\nI've noticed an inconsistency while checking colors based on Manhattan distances. For the point (0,2), I expect a distance of 2 to (0,0) to give a color of 7, but it shows 8. I reconsidered the distance approach, possibly reversing the coloring scheme for odd and even distances. \n\nHowever, checking distances to a second special point at (9,0) leads to more mismatches. It seems I might only be able to use one special point, which represents a shape defined by (0,0) to (9,0). The output indicates a grid pattern where certain positions have consistent coloring. I need to analyze the grid's structure more carefully!**Exploring grid patterns and distances**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid pattern, specifically a tiling of 3x3 squares. It appears there's a repeating structure, with a basic block height of 3 rows, but the entire grid has 10 rows. I noticed the pattern fluctuates between two types based on the row's index, partially resembling a checkerboard.\n\nWhen looking at distances to special points, I'm finding some inconsistencies in the output. For example, at (0,0), the distance to (0,6) is 6, which should indicate a color of 1, but it shows 8 instead. It seems like the method for determining colors might involve more than just straightforward parity, possibly considering Chebyshev distance or other criteria. This warrants a deeper examination!",
