    "reasoning": "**Analyzing matrix output**\n\nI'm looking to understand how the input matrix is being transformed into the output. The rows indicate numbers, but the output only has two rows: [3, 3, 3, 6, 3] and [3, 6, 6, 3, 3]. It seems like those might be averages or some representation of blocks.\n\nI notice that the distinct values in column one of the input range from 2 to 8. The dimensions of the output grid are 2x5, suggesting I'm selecting two rows from the possible five. This may relate to grouping by the majority color in the distinct patterns.**Understanding output row patterns**\n\nI'm examining the input rows to determine how they correspond to the two output rows. Row 4 shows a pattern dominated by 2s, with a 6, and Row 5 is a mix of 2s and 6s. It seems the output averages unique row patterns and groups them accordingly.\n\nFor the first output row [3, 3, 3, 6, 3], I find that it corresponds to Row 4, where 2s are replaced with 3. For the second output row [3, 6, 6, 3, 3], this matches Row 5 with a similar mapping. It appears the output prioritizes these mixed patterns, ignoring rows with more consistent values.**Mapping color patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing how colors are mapped in the examples. For instance, the first example maps colors 2 to 3 and 6 to itself. It seems that colors not part of the main patterns, like 7 and 8, are discarded. Overall, this suggests a strategy of recoloring background shapes based on their patterns while favoring smaller, distinct color groups.\n\nIn the grid example, I'm identifying shapes that appear twice, such as clusters of 2 and 6. It looks like I'm focused on completing shapes that mirror each other while overlooking larger groups in the upper part, especially the 6 shapes. This approach seems to help highlight specific patterns for output.",
