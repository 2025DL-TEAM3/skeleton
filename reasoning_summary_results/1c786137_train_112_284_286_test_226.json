Zeros each have 1 loop, so I need to count all the zeros across multiple rows. It turns out there are 16 zeros, leading to a total of 26 loops when I add everything together. I don't see any 8s, 4s, or 1s in my counting, so their counts remain as none.**Counting digit occurrences**\n\nFor this task, I'm noticing that multiple digits, like 0, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are missing. It's challenging to identify colors as well. Looking at the corners of the grid in example 1, I find that 0 appears most frequently twice. In example 2, all corner digits appear only once, resulting in no one-digit majority. \n\nAfter examining occurrences from the grids, it seems the output corresponds to digits that appear uniquely. In example 3, I identify several digits, with 2, 7, and 4 all appearing once. Ultimately, it looks like I'm interested in those unique counts.**Identifying hollow shapes and outputs**\n\nI'm considering how zeros create shapes in the background. In example one, the zeros form shapes resembling digit figures, particularly with the number 6, which resembles a hollow rectangle shape matching 0. However, in other examples, like with the 8s and 5s, they also form similar hollow rectangles but yield different outputs. \n\nThe rule to find the output is to detect these hollow 3x3 shapes, identify their border and center. So, with a new input grid, I'll verify if any 3x3 regions fit this pattern.",
