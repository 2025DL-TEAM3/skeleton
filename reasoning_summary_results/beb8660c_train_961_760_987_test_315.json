There are three training sets to examine, and my goal is to uncover the underlying rule. It looks like we're working with text grids that contain characters and digits, which likely represent various colors. I need to analyze these elements carefully to determine how they relate to each other and the outputs. Let's dig in and find that rule!**Analyzing training examples**\n\nI'm looking at several training examples where the input consists of number grids, and I want to find the rule that maps these inputs to their respective outputs. \n\nIn the inputs, it appears that the rightmost columns or rows are altered, possibly rotating digits to create a more uniform appearance. For instance, in Example 2, both the input and output have the same size, which seems consistent. \n\nSo, I need to examine how these modifications are applied to establish a clearer transformation rule.**Examining Example 2**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down Example 2, where the input consists of rows of digits and comparing it to the output. It seems like the anomalies in rows have shifted downwards. For instance, the 9s from row 4 drop to row 6, while the 6s from row 5 appear in row 7. \n\nIt's interesting to note that although the baseline color is consistent, the blocks seem to fall, maintaining their relative order but perhaps rearranging by size. I\u2019ll need to investigate how this transformation occurs, particularly the movement patterns of these unique columns.",
