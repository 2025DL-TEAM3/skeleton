For instance, in the first example, I noticed that the first two digits of row one are 21, and those of row two are 11. This seems consistent across examples, as I also see it in example two with 29 and 23. It looks like I can always extract the first two digits from the first two rows, suggested by k being equal to 2.**Establishing output grid rules**\n\nI'm figuring out the task, which seems to require extracting the first two columns from only the first two rows of an input grid. The examples show consistent patterns, so I can expect a 2x2 output format. Given an input like:\n\n```\n737\n793\n717\n177\n403\n737\n747\n077\n```\n\nWith rows presenting in a grid format, the task is clear: always pull the first two columns from the first two rows, giving outputs like '21' and '11' in some cases, confirming a consistent 2x2 rule.**Confirming output grid**\n\nFor the test input, I see that the first two columns from the first two rows yield '73' from 737 and '79' from 793. So the grid outputs correctly as:\n\n```\n73\n79\n```\n\nI'm double-checking: row one gives '73' (7 and 3), and row two gives '79' (7 and 9). \n\nThat appears consistent, and the task seems straightforward, focusing on those first two rows and columns. While I'm considering if there's more complexity involved, the simplest solution is simply to take those values. So I believe the answer is indeed correct!",
    "test_output_text": "73\n79\n",
    "correct": true
