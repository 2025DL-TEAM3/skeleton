For example, given the input grid, the output creates a symmetrical 8x8 pattern that mirrors around the center. Let\u2019s keep analyzing this!**Analyzing quadrant transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing how to transform a 4x4 grid into an 8x8 output grid. The top-left quadrant remains unchanged, while the top-right reflects a horizontal flip of the original. The bottom-left quadrant mirrors it vertically, and the bottom-right rotates it 180 degrees. I\u2019m validating this with specific example grids to ensure the transformations hold. For smaller grids, like a 1-row example, the outputs consistently match expected transformations, confirming my approach is correct. Let\u2019s keep testing!**Finalizing output from input grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the transformation of the input \"668,\" which is one row with three columns. The output dimensions will be 2x6. The first row will replicate the original followed by its horizontal mirror. So, the first row becomes \"668866.\" The second row mirrors the first, resulting in \"668866\" again. This confirms the consistency of the transformation across both rows. Overall, the output effectively retains a pattern, ensuring it's compact yet symmetrical. I feel confident this checks out!",
