    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle grids**\n\nI\u2019m working on an ARC puzzle that involves input and output grids. The input is an 8x8 grid, confirmed by counting the characters in the first line. With grids like \"99799919,\" it matches the structure. The output grid is the same size, making it easier to analyze in relation to the examples. I\u2019ll compare each cell in both the input and output to understand how values are transformed. Let\u2019s map this out step by step!**Mapping grid transformations**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle, focusing on how values change in the grids provided. In the first example, it appears that some numbers stay the same while others change, like 4 and 6, which remain consistent. Most 8s convert to 2, but there are exceptions, particularly when they\u2019re adjacent to other numbers. The second example is a 7x9 grid, showing similar transformation patterns, suggesting there are specific rules for these number mappings that I need to clarify. Let's outline those relationships!**Investigating grid mapping anomalies**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing why row 5, column 4 has a different output. It seems like 8 maps to 2, while other 8s map to 6 elsewhere. This suggests there's a unique rule at play, potentially related to surrounding numbers. I wonder if these mappings depend on regional shapes within the grid. Background zones might be filled based on their proximity to non-background colors or surrounding obstacles. I\u2019ll need to identify and visualize these regions to uncover any patterns hiding behind the numbers!**Computing output for grid transformation**\n\nI\u2019m mapping numbers in a base grid where 9s become 2s. Initially, I\u2019ve processed each row and generated new values based on the mapping. For rows 1 to 4, I\u2019m extending values at column 4 to 7, making necessary corrections to rows 5 through 8 afterward. I\u2019ve reviewed input and output to ensure continuity and checked for conflicts in row 3. This mapping aligns well with the expected shape extensions based on previous examples. Here\u2019s the final output of the grid: \n\n```\n22772212\n22272222\n72272122\n22172222\n22272122\n12271222\n72222211\n22222121\n```",
