It seems I'm discovering some mapping issues. For instance, block mappings for input cells need indexing adjustments. After recalibrating, I realize block assignments: block00 corresponds to input(0,0), block01 to input(0,1), block10 to input(1,0), and block11 to input(1,1). It's important to track the values accurately for the output grid.**Examining input patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a 5x5 input grid that contains some ones and a single nine. It looks like it might represent a path from the top-left corner to the nine using Manhattan moves. The nine is found at (4,4), and there are one values at (3,3), (3,4), and (4,3). This suggests a mapping where each input cell turns into a corresponding 2x2 block in a 10x10 output grid. Specifically, zeros map to uniform ones, while ones create a pattern mixing ones and nines.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing how to create a 4x4 output grid based on a 2x2 input. I've noted that specific rules govern the mapping of inputs to outputs. For instance, each row and column has identifiable patterns based on inputs labeled as a, b, c, and d. I've identified configurations such as row0 being [a,b,a,b] and how values map consistently across rows.\n\nGiven input values like (3,7), I've established the resulting output as:  \n3737  \n3333  \n3333  \n3733  \n\nThis confirms the mapping was successful!",
