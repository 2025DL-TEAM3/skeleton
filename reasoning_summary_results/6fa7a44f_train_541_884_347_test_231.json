In the first example, the input is two lines: \"23\" and \"94,\" resulting in a symmetric vertical mirror output of four lines: 23, 94, 94, 23. \n\nFor the second example, five lines are given, and the output doubles that to ten lines, appending the rows in reverse order. So, it seems the rule involves creating a symmetrical pattern by reflecting the rows vertically and following a palindrome structure.**Clarifying output rules**\n\nI\u2019m working on the rule for transforming an input grid. The pattern involves taking the original rows and then adding them in reverse order to create a new grid. For example, given an input with four rows, the output will consist of those four rows followed by the same rows in reverse, making eight rows total.\n\nFor a five-row input, there would be ten rows in total, with the first five being identical to the input and the second five being the input rows reversed.
