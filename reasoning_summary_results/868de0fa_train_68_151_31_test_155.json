    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the hollow shape border**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a hollow shape created by 3s in a grid from rows 2 to 7 and columns 1 to 7. It seems that the suspected center area, originally filled with 3s, has changed to 2s in the output. The output for row 2 shows all 2s in the border, meaning the original 3s were completely replaced. I need to compare the input and output for row 2 to understand the transformation better. Overall, the changes indicate a transition that likely filled both the border and interior.**Understanding digit patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a 10-digit string, \"6222222633\", and breaking it down: the first digit is 6, followed by six 2s, then another 6, and finally two 3s. I realize I'm comparing this to the input \"6333333633,\" where the changes in values catch my attention, especially that c6 changed from 6 to 2, which suggests a larger pattern at play. I\u2019m focusing on a rectangular region within the grid that seems to have a donut shape, surrounded by 3s and filled with 2s in the interior. Time to detect the connected components!**Identifying shape replacement rules**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how the colors change within the shapes in different examples. In example 1, the fives create a border while replacing the interior with sevens. This suggests that the replacement color isn't strictly tied to the original shape's color. I'm trying to figure out the rules behind these changes. I noticed that example 3 forms a large rectangle with a 6s border and originally has a 3s interior, which is filled with 2. The challenge now is to define the rectangular border and understand the pattern for filling the interior area.",
