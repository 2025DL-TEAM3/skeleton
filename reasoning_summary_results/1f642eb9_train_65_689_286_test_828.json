    "reasoning": "**Analyzing distances and patterns**\n\nI see the minimum value at A is 3, leading to an output of 2. However, then I calculate the distances to other points and find the minimum is A at 4, but that output is 4, not matching. Maybe ties are being handled differently than expected. \n\nIn a second example, I'm examining seeds around a big block of 9. I need to scope out all non-9 values in the specified area, looking for seeds in a specific region. I\u2019ll keep digging!**Examining region shapes**\n\nI'm taking a closer look at different region shapes. \n\nIn Example 1, the region is a uniform 4x4 square of color 4, while Example 2 shows a 3x4 rectangle filled with 9s. Moving to Example 3, it changes to a 4x2 vertical rectangle of 9s. Each region seems to follow a uniform color pattern, and I need to identify how values are assigned based on their position relative to the region's origin.\n\nExtracting example values reveals patterns where some cells change while others, like boundary points, remain the same. I'll keep digging into these adjacency relationships!**Analyzing pattern shapes and regions**\n\nI'm considering whether the same numerical shapes overlay all regions. For instance, the 4x4 region from Example 1 might influence the 3x4 and 4x2 regions in Examples 2 and 3. \n\nHowever, when I compare patterns, they don\u2019t appear directly similar. Each region seems to have distinct color influences, suggesting that patterns follow certain rules based on color. I\u2019ll need to explore how shapes and bordering pixels might play into these computations further and consider run-length indices for determining values for each output. This analysis is getting quite intricate!",
