    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI'm working through a puzzle about transforming input grids of characters into smaller output grids. The rule seems to involve examining each line and removing repeated trailing patterns. For example, each line in the first example has four characters, and the outputs are simply the first two. But I\u2019m curious if this holds for all lines or if it changes with different lengths. There\u2019s a hint that the rule might be about identifying repeating patterns, especially in longer lines.**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a series of input grids and their corresponding outputs. It looks like the outputs consist of matching the first five characters from each line. However, I notice some variations, especially with shorter entries like \u201c97\u201d and \u201c78.\u201d They both output their full length, suggesting perhaps they don\u2019t crop two-character lines. I\u2019m leaning towards the idea that the rule might involve removing duplicates from repeating patterns while maintaining unique sequences. Overall, I'm seeing that preserving distinct rows seems to be a key part of this process.**Identifying grid patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing an 8x9 grid and trying to determine if there's any repetition. Comparing the rows reveals that rows 1 and 5, 2 and 6, 3 and 7, and 4 and 8 are identical, suggesting vertical repetition through blocks of height 4. However, the width is 9, which is odd, meaning I can't have equal horizontal repeats. So, I conclude that I should only output the first four rows while keeping the width intact. This results in the final output as those first four rows.",
