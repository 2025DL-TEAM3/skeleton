This process seems consistent across the other rows as well.**Evaluating output patterns and rules**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the patterns in output sequences, particularly looking at how segments repeat. For instance, I see \"753\" is repeated to fill the row. Following this, I noticed a consistent approach: identifying the initial segment before a break, which seems to be length 3 in most cases.\n\nThis pattern depends on the width of the grid, as I see examples with different widths causing distinct transformations. In some cases, they reorder entire rows, while in others, they adjust digits within rows. The rules differ based on the number of rows and columns.",
