    "reasoning": "**Analyzing output discrepancies**\n\nIt looks like the output has 9 columns, so I\u2019m trying to understand this situation. The first output row is \"190919009,\" which shows 9 digits, while the input only has 8 rows. It's possible some zeros are suppressed. \n\nFor example, looking at the first column, I notice it contributes to that 9th digit. The second output row \"911101991\" also follows this pattern. I need to break down the inputs more comprehensively to figure out this discrepancy.**Identifying output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that there's an extra digit at the end of some output rows, and in the second row, they seem to append a \"1\" at the end. \n\nSo, when I compare input and output grids, it looks like the outputs have an extra digit appended for each row. This might be a pattern where the last element of the output could be repeating the first element of the input row or something similar. It's a bit puzzling, but I think this could mean the output rows are actually a transposed version of the input, with one extra digit added in each case.**Creating the grid output**\n\nI'm looking to represent the input in a 2x9 grid with these values. First, I lay out the rows, where Row1 is [7, 8, 4, 7, 7, 2, 4, 7, 7] and Row2 is [7, 7, 7, 1, 7, 9, 7, 2, 7]. \n\nFrom those rows, I can extract the columns: col1 has [7,7], col2 has [8,7], and so on. Each row output should be two digits. So, I want to ensure the output, which consists of these pairs, maintains the intended 9 rows, each with two digits, and aligns correctly. Everything checks out, so I'm ready to finalize it.",
