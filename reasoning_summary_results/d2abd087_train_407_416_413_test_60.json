    "reasoning": "**Deciphering color patterns**\n\nI'm trying to identify a rectangular cluster of a color in an input grid, specifically targeting colors that aren't the background. I want to recolor these identified areas with a new color, potentially derived from the first digit of the row. In my example, I notice several occurrences of the number 4, alongside patterns of 1's, 3's, and 6's.  Also, I've counted the rows and confirmed there's a total of 10 rows, not 9 as I initially thought.**Counting rows and mapping colors**\n\nI realize there are actually 10 rows based on the input provided, even though I initially thought there were 9. Each row has 9 digits, creating a grid that\u2019s 10 rows high. This is a bit strange since the previous examples differed in dimensions. \n\nNow, I'm mapping non-background colors to new values: for instance, it looks like 1 becomes 2, 3 becomes 2, and 6 maps to 1. I need to clarify all these mappings as I go along to ensure accuracy.**Mapping color rules**\n\nI\u2019m examining how colors in different rows are transformed, and I\u2019ve established some patterns. For instance, in row 6, 4 becomes 2 and 9 becomes 1. In row 8, both 4 and 5 are mapped to 2. The rule seems to revolve around identifying non-background colors and determining their new values. \n\nThe largest non-background color typically gets mapped to 1, while the smaller ones are mapped to 2. However, I've noticed inconsistencies when only one non-background color is present\u2014it defaults to 2. Hence, if multiple non-background colors exist, the largest likely becomes 1, others 2.",
