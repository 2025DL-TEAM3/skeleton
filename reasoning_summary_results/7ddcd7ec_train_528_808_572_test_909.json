Row 3 contains non-zero values at (3,1) and (3,2), while Row 4 has values at (4,0) and (4,3). With Rows 5 and 6 having zeros, I updated Row 0 to include a 7 at (0,4). So now I'm isolating the positions of color 7 and noting other significant entries.**Analyzing diagonal pairs**\n\nI'm observing pairs of numbers in the matrix: two 3s, two 8s, and the same for 1s and 7s. Each pair forms diagonal relationships, either leaning NW-SE or down-right, depending on the color. For example, the 7s are at (1,3) and (2,2) creating a diagonal segment. The output should keep original placements unchanged while adding new segments, like the 7 at (0,4). For the 8s, they extend down to fill empty spaces. This way, each diagonal maintains its characteristics.",
