Rows 3 and 4 (9898 and 9988) are different, while the others (all 8888) are uniform. My output is thus \"989\" and \"998,\" which reflects the distinct content minus the trailing 8. So, I\u2019m effectively isolating any rows that deviate from being uniform and trimming the trailing 8s to focus solely on the unique components. Overall, it's about finding and simplifying the variations.**Identifying irregular grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m examining a 7-row grid, where most rows are uniform (77777), except for rows 2, 3, and 4, which are 77977. The distinct element in those irregular rows is \u201c9,\u201d which appears three times. The output, \u201c9,\u201d reflects the unique value found in the irregular rows. The overall rule seems to be extracting these patterns by identifying distinct values while dropping uniform edges. For example, from 9898, I drop the last 8 to get \u201c989.\u201d It's all about isolating the special elements!**Cropping the grid**\n\nI\u2019m working with a grid of 3 rows and 8 columns, looking for a background color and any unusual colors. The background here is 7, which appears everywhere except for two 6s, located at (1,6) and (2,5) in 1-based indexing. \n\nAfter mapping 0-based indices, I've identified the 6s' positions, and I'm calculating the bounding rectangle, which covers rows 0 to 1 and columns 4 to 5. This yields a 2x2 grid: '76' from row 0 and '67' from row 1. So, the final output is simply:\n\n76  \n67",
