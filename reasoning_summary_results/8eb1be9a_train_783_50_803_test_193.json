It seems that rows 1, 3, and 5 have one version, while rows 2, 4, and 6 match another. The unique rows are notable too\u2014like row 2 having \"499443194\" and row 3 featuring \"494444444.\" So, for the output, I think I'll apply these patterns consistently, maintaining that alternating structure.**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m identifying the output rows based on patterns in the input. For example, the first output alternates between two patterns: \"494444444\" and \"499443194,\" which appear in the input rows. In another case, I see two special rows: \"448484\" and \"444744\" that serve as the basis for the output. So, I plan to apply this pattern across all examples, ensuring that I identify and use unique, non-uniform rows while ignoring the uniform entries.**Finalizing output pattern**\n\nI'm reviewing the examples to determine which rows to use based on their positions relative to the center of the grid. For instance, in example 2, row 7 is closer to the center than row 8, so it becomes my pattern P. Similarly, for example 3, row 3 is closer to the center, making it P as well. \n\nSo for my test input with 8 rows, I conclude that P will be row 2 (86888) and Q will be row 1 (88688). From there, I can lay out the output as alternating these two patterns correctly!",
