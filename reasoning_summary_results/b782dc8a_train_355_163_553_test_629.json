For even distances, I\u2019m confirming the output is 2, and for odd distances, the output is 7. I'm validating calculations for various positions, ensuring that they align with expected outputs based on their distances. Everything checks out perfectly! Each calculation reinforces that I\u2019m on the right track, with alternating color logic applied correctly throughout the cells. Everything matches exactly as it should!**Analyzing coloring rules**\n\nI'm working with a connected region of one color, which typically involves coloring regions based on seeds and distances. For instance, starting from a seed colored 2, I'll alternate colors 2 and 7 based on Manhattan distance for zeros in that region. It looks like I\u2019ll need to identify the right regions and seeds in the input examples. \n\nFor Example 3, the surrounding zeros require careful evaluation, especially since identifying seeds might be tricky without clear inputs for 2 and 7. I'll keep checking output changes closely to ensure I'm grasping how regions are defined and filled!**Examining regions and seeds**\n\nI'm analyzing the input to identify regions filled by colors based on seeds. Here, Example 3's zero region and the constraints of neighboring colors become crucial. I notice there's only a seed of 7. I have to consider how this seed affects the surrounding region of 8s. \n\nThe zeros act as barriers, creating distinct components of 8s. It seems I need to map out the clusters of zeros and 8s in the rows and see how they interact. This analysis will help determine which areas can be filled based on the seed location!**Analyzing color regions and connectivity**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing how seeds, specifically 2 and 7, affect filling regions of colors in the grid. The zeros in the rows seem to create isolated areas within the color clusters. I noticed that only regions connected to seeds will be filled with those alternating colors based on their distance. \n\nI also need to check which clusters of 3s are linked to the seed colors to determine if they will change and how the zeros serve as barriers. This understanding will guide the filling process accurately!",
