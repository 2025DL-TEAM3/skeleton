    "reasoning": "**Analyzing number transformations**\n\nI\u2019m observing how some nines were changed into smaller numbers across different columns. For instance, in one row, 9 transforms to 1, while in another, 1 becomes 4. It looks like these changes propagate through the rows. \n\nWhen pulling up some examples, I note the differences between input and output patterns\u2014like how certain numbers consistently change while others remain the same. There seems to be a specific shape emerging from these modifications, particularly with a block formation across specific rows and columns.**Examining number patterns**\n\nI've noticed that in this block, numbers changed significantly: nines are transforming into either ones or remaining the same, while ones become fours. It seems there's a diagonal pattern forming based on where the original ones were located. \n\nThe two spots marked with ones (at (1,4) and (3,5)) turn into fours in the output. Surrounding these, there\u2019s a filling of ones that creates a unique shape, possibly resembling a rotated L. As I examine a new input, I'm trying to identify where the distinct non-twos lie.**Identifying number connections**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the output to identify where the new sevens appear. They're located across several rows and columns, particularly between clusters of six. It seems like the original six positions help propagate sevens horizontally across rows. \n\nI notice two main clusters of six that connect through these newly formed sevens. The pathway created is L-shaped, marking the connections between clustered positions. Additionally, I see that some original areas have been replaced or altered, indicating they serve as pivots for these connections. It\u2019s interesting how they bring together different sections!**Finalizing the pattern transformation**\n\nI\u2019m working through the transformation of clusters, particularly focusing on the 3s and 9s. I see that it's best to take the shape of the 3 clusters and apply it to the 9s. The original 9s will be marked as 4. As I model the output, I recognize only horizontal connectors are necessary between cluster areas instead of vertical or diagonal ones. \n\nThe final output shows the numbered transformations clearly, creating the expected connections while indicating positions for clarity. By organizing everything together, I feel confident about presenting this result!",
