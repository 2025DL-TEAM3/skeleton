In Exam 1, I noticed how positions with '3's in the input are transformed to '2's in certain output rows. Specifically, in rows 3, 5, and 6, the first character of the 4-column string changes. The pattern reveals that the middle '8' in input row 3 was swapped for '2' in the output, but I\u2019m trying to clarify why this happens consistently.**Identifying transformation rules**\n\nI've realized the pattern here: in specific rows like 3838, the second character changes from 8 to 2. This also happens for rows 5 and 6. When there's a 3 at both ends, an 8 in the middle becomes a 2. Rows only containing 8s stay the same; they change the 8 to 2 only if it\u2019s flanked by two 3s. Now, testing this for other examples reveals that a similar rule applies: an adjacent 4 to two 1s also becomes a 2.",
