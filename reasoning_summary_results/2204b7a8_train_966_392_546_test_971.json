For row 2, I see input 859555957 maps to output 858555757, where positions indicate changes in digits primarily from 9 to either 8 or 7. \n\nLooking at row 3, the 855555997 changes to 855555777, where the transformation happened at specific positions. Notably, 9s sometimes convert to 7s or 8s, depending on their neighbors. It seems the adjacency of digits might influence their mapping!**Investigating Number Connections**\n\nI'm considering if certain digits, particularly 9s, are connected. Although some are isolated with neighbors of 5, there are differences in how they change. Columns may be significant, where counting 9s could help with mapping. \n\nIt seems like shape detection is playing a role, with 9s possibly forming specific shapes based on local context. I should take a closer look at the grid arrangement, which has a prominent collection of 5s surrounded by other numbers. The input consists of 10 rows, confirming my earlier counting!**Examining Borders for Color Mapping**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the example input, which is a 6-column grid with different values. The leftmost column has varying entries, while the rightmost column also shows diversity. It seems like there's a pattern where the nearest border or non-zero color influences how we fill interiors. Specifically, for the value 4 found in row 3, column 0, the nearest border color (5) is replaced based on proximity. \n\nThis suggests a general rule: for interior colors, replace them with the color of the closest non-zero border. I'll keep an eye on the horizontal and vertical distance rules too!**Finalizing Output Rows**\n\nI\u2019m going through the rows and verifying the outputs based on the input values. For instance, row 2 maps to 55119, while row 3 remains 51119. As I examine row 4, I see that it transforms to 55199 due to adjustments in specific columns, following the established rules.\n\nAfter confirming the inputs and outputs from each row, I note that the output should consistently have five characters per line. Thus, the final sequence stands as:\n\n51119  \n55119  \n55119  \n51119  \n55199  \n55199  \n51119  \n\nI\u2019m pleased with this conclusion!",
