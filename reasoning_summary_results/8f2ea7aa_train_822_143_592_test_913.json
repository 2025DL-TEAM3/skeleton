    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the ARC puzzle**\n\nI\u2019ve got an ARC puzzle to solve! There are three training examples that I need to use to infer the rule. In the first example, I see an input grid and an output grid. \n\nThe interesting part is how the output seems to tile a 2x2 submatrix formed by the non-zero digits from the input. The non-zero values are arranged in a way that they\u2019re shifted in the output. So, I\u2019m starting to see the pattern here that may help with the other examples!**Examining grid patterns**\n\nI've arranged the output grid: it shows some repetitions, but it isn't entirely symmetric. The first two rows repeat the non-zero values from the input while ensuring zeros are placed correctly. \n\nLooking into another example with a 9x9 grid, I see a 3x3 colored block. The output reflects this block tiled across the grid. This means I can extract specific rows and columns from the input to form the pattern.\n\nSo, I need to confirm that the non-zero entries are structured in a 3x3 block format that gets repeated in the output!**Defining tile replication rules**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how the patterns fill the grid with the colored blocks. Each tile of the pattern is replicated strategically, but it doesn\u2019t fill every possible space. It seems the output retains some of the original rows intact, especially when they consist of only background values.\n\nFor tiling the output, the rule appears to be replicating the colored non-background block only in certain positions that align with the original pattern's height and width. This creates a specific tiling effect, but some placements are skipped based on whether they overlap fully with blocks of background. I need to clarify that original positions influence where the tiles get placed without losing the consistent structure!",
