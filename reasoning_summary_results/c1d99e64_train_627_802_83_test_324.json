    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid puzzle transformations**\n\nI'm looking into a grid puzzle with some interesting transformations on digits. In the given examples, the transformations change 1s to 2s, but not consistently. For instance, in the first two rows, all 1s become 2s, while in the third row, only the first 1 changes to a 2, leaving the second 1 unchanged. It seems the changes might depend on the position of the digits and their connection to the 9s. I should investigate this further!**Mapping the 9 region in the grid**\n\nI'm trying to locate the 9 region within the grid. It appears as a block in the top right, and there's an additional box at the bottom. I'm noting that changes happen in cells near the 9s. For example, in row 5, the 1 becomes a 2 because of its adjacency to a 9. I\u2019m also considering if diagonal neighbors count toward adjacency, which raises questions about the transformation rules for 1s to 2s. This is quite a puzzle to unravel!**Examining connectivity in the grid**\n\nI\u2019m trying to determine how to mark the 1's that connect to the border of the grid. It seems only some 1 regions will change, and those that aren't surrounded by 9 should be processed differently. I noticed two separate 1 regions: one linked to the outer edge and another within the 9's. The shape of the 9s forms a U, and I'm identifying all 1 positions. It\u2019s interesting to see how the 9 regions create clusters and how the surrounding 1's react to changes. I\u2019ll need to consider connections for border proximity and potential enclosure rules!**Implementing replacement rule**\n\nI\u2019m determining the replacement rule for zeros in the grid. According to the rules, I need to change zeros in row 4 and column 1 to 2 while leaving other zeros alone. I noticed that in previous examples, shapes were replaced with 2, which guides my process here. \n\nI\u2019ll produce the final output by adjusting all qualifying zeros to 2, ensuring to verify each row's changes. The result looks correct, so I believe I've completed this successfully!",
