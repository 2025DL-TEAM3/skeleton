    "reasoning": "**Exploring the matrix transformation**\n\nI\u2019m visualizing the input as a number matrix, particularly focusing on the coordinates where the values aren\u2019t 9. It seems there\u2019s a roughly 2x2 cluster in a rotated shape. As I analyze the output pattern, it appears the original cluster might be rotated by 90 degrees. For example, I note the coordinates and corresponding values, like (5,7): 2 and (6,4): 1. Overall, it\u2019s appearing as a plus shape, revealing an intriguing relationship in the data!**Analyzing matrix shapes**\n\nI'm looking at a cluster centered around coordinates (6,5) and (6,6). The non-9 values seem to form an L-shaped pattern when I adjust my reference point to (5,4). Once I map out the values, I find a mirrored shape in the output, which looks quite symmetrical.\n\nFor the coordinates I've noted, the values form a 4x4 block. Interestingly, the output retains some values from the input matrix, suggesting a convolution or transformation happened. Plus, it appears to maintain symmetry across the main diagonal!**Analyzing patterns in a grid**\n\nI'm inspecting input column patterns, particularly focusing on columns 3 to 8 and their mirrored representations. I notice mismatches between expected and actual values in the mirrored rows. It seems that the cases involve symmetries, such as 180-degree symmetry and rotations, to fill the grid effectively.\n\nLooking at the original 7x7 grid, it shows a background with a central shape made of distinct digits. My task is to replicate these patterns while respecting the observed symmetries from earlier cases. Ultimately, I want to apply these rules to achieve a symmetric pattern in this larger grid.**Verifying symmetric block**\n\nI'm checking the block for symmetry by comparing it with the original shape. For each corresponding point, I find matches, confirming the original values align with block B. I check various rotation mappings, like R90 and R180, and each point still holds true. \n\nFinally, the output reflects the correct shape based on my checks, ensuring no conflicts with the original values. Everything seems in order, and I'm ready to present the final output confirmed with accuracy.",
