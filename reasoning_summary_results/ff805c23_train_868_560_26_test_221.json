    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzles**\n\nI'm exploring ARC puzzles, starting with training examples. The first input is a 10x10 grid filled with digits leading to an output of three lines, indicating three rows of one column. The second example shows a 10x10 grid producing a single output line with seven columns, and the third provides an 8x8 input resulting in three rows. It seems the challenge involves identifying connected regions of zeros within these patterns. I'll look closely at the positions of digits, especially focusing on the occurrences of 6's, 7's, and 0's.**Exploring puzzle patterns**\n\nLooking at Row 8, where there's a sequence of digits, I\u2019m seeing how the 7's might form an interesting shape\u2014perhaps a diamond or an X around zeros. I\u2019ll draw a rough matrix based on the descriptions of the rows. For rows 3, 4, and 5, zeros are vertically aligned in column 7, with 7's surrounding them, hinting at an arrow-like structure. The output seems to depend on counting occurrences of the digit 6 across rows. For the second example, a symmetric pattern emerges with zeros and 3\u2019s, leading me to consider how these relate to the central output patterns.**Calculating output via mirroring**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to mirror the data across the vertical axis. For the column calculation, I\u2019m using the formula, which gives me the new column index. Then, for each zero found in the original positions, I\u2019m determining the corresponding output based on the original row numbers in ascending order. This results in an output grid with a shape of 2x1. Looking at the specific inputs, I see that row one outputs a value of 1, and row two outputs a value of 7, leading me to finalize the results as:\n\n1  \n7",
