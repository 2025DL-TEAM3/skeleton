In the second case, there's a reverse order in outputs, like input colors of 9, 3, and 0 mapped to outputs of 0, 3, and 9. This suggests a symmetric mapping. I'm also considering how different layers are swapped, especially in examples with multiple layers. It seems the innermost and outermost colors are switched.**Understanding color layer mappings**\n\nI see that the innermost color is 5, followed by 8, 3, and then the outermost 4. They reversed the layers without changing the shape. It\u2019s like an inversion where I list the colors from outside to inside: [5, 8, 3, 4], which reverses to [4, 3, 8, 5]. For example 2, the outer layer of 9 maps to 0, creating symmetry. In example 3, a grid reveals two distinct color layers of 7 and 5, confirming the pattern perfectly!**Mapping colors in the grid**\n\nI\u2019m mapping colors where 2 becomes 4 and 4 becomes 2. For the output, row 1 with all 2s changes to 4444. Row 2 transforms from 2 4 4 2 to 4 2 2 4, resulting in 4224 for rows 2 through 5, and row 6 remains 4444. So, the final grid looks like this:\n\n4444  \n4224  \n4224  \n4224  \n4224  \n4444  \n\nI\u2019ve confirmed that there are no other layers or colors, so this output is correct!",
