    "reasoning": "**Evaluating color rule for regions**\n\nI'm considering the color rule where I identify regions of noise against a uniform background. It gets tricky since I'm dealing with digits representing colored pixels. For example, in a grid, I'd flood fill regions of colored cells with the background. \n\nIn one example, there are distinct regions with 1's, 6's with anomalies, 3's with issues, and 8's. Each region has pairs of rows. The output should reflect the perfect areas while noting anomalies too.**Assessing color blocks**\n\nI'm working on a rule for contiguous blocks of rows with constant values, focusing on fixing anomalies by replacing them with the majority color of the block. Each block is marked by stable rows, so I need to determine the target color.\n\nFor example, in one set of rows, rows 1-2 are all zeros, defining one block. In another, rows 3-6 mostly show 2's but have anomalies without a perfect uniform row. In cases like that, I can take the dominant color, which is 2. For different examples, I might need to consider blocks by columns when uniform rows aren't available.**Identifying color rectangles**\n\nI'm figuring out how to handle uniform color regions, focusing on correcting anomalies. The strategy is to first identify blocks of columns or rows that remain constant, separating them with anomalies. When rows show consistent vertical stripes, I should fill them; if columns are mostly consistent horizontally, I'd fill those instead.\n\nIn the grid, if there's no consistent column across rows, I treat them as horizontal stripes. The next step is to apply this to test inputs to find and fill rectangles of solid colors affected by noise, either horizontally or vertically.**Analyzing rows for uniformity**\n\nI'm checking for rows consistent across all columns to identify horizontal stripes. Rows 6-10 are all zeros, creating a block of uniform color. Looking at rows 1-5, they mostly show 7's with some noisy entries. \n\nAfter analyzing, it's clear that rows 1-5 can be considered a block of 7's since the mode is 7, even if there isn\u2019t a perfect row. Therefore, I'll replace all entries in rows 1-5 with 7's, maintaining zeros in rows 6-10. My final output should be correctly formatted with ten rows.",
