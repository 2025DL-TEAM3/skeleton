Adding some 3\u2019s around the center between the 8\u2019s seems necessary. In row 2, column 4 has a value of 3, confirmed by its position. For row 3, there's a horizontal line of 3\u2019s spanning columns 3, 4, and 5. The positions for this plus sign extend from (3,4) to its neighbors.**Clarifying the plus sign placement**\n\nThe two 8\u2019s at (3,0) and (3,7) remain unchanged as endpoints, while everything else stays 2. In the next example, I see an 8x7 grid filled with 7\u2019s, and two 6\u2019s located at (4,2) and (4,6). They kept the 6\u2019s and placed a plus sign of 3\u2019s centered at (4,4). So, I confirm that rows 3, 4, and 5 have consistent values, with the plus arms extending appropriately. The key is that special endpoints stay intact while the plus fills in the middle.",
