    "reasoning": "**Understanding matrix rotations**\n\nIt looks like the process involves rotating a 2x2 block by 180 degrees. The original matrix is [1, 7; 8, 6], with coordinates mapping directly to positions in a greater grid. When creating a similar block in the border region, it turns into [6, 8; 7, 1]. \n\nI can see that this operation is effectively flipping the original matrix across both axes, confirming that this is indeed a 180-degree rotation since the new matrix matches perfectly with what's expected.**Analyzing border thickness**\n\nI'm examining an example where the outermost rows are rows 1 and 6, but I realize there are seven rows in total. The seventh row isn't used as a border, which is puzzling since the bottom border should logically include it. Rows 1, 2, and 6 are filled with 4s, which seems to indicate a border, but only row 1 maintains a consistent border of 4s. The bottom appears to have two layers of thickness, which makes the shape asymmetrical. Rows 2 to 5 contain different elements, defining an interesting inner shape.**Understanding corner placements in grid**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that certain columns and rows don't align as expected. For instance, columns 4 and 8 are skipped in favor of 3 and 9, creating a rectangle defined by rows 2 to 8 and columns 3 to 9. Within this area, I see a 2x2 block that\u2019s being rotated 180 degrees. It seems there\u2019s a methodical approach, where sections are defined by color borders: the outer color forms the background, followed by another color that creates a rectangle. Following the established rules, this consistent placement process should be applied to any given puzzle layout!**Transforming the grid**\n\nI'm rewriting the input as an array of rows labeled 1 to 10, where most values are 2 except for a few specific changes in rows 6, 7, and 8. After applying the removal process to update certain cells, I change row 7's fourth column from 8 to 4 and the sixth column from 0 to 4. Similarly, row 8's fourth column updates from 3 to 4 and sixth from 6 to 4.\n\nNext, I add new values to specific positions. The final grid looks as follows: \n\n22222222  \n22222222  \n22222222  \n22222222  \n26222223  \n22444442  \n22442442  \n22442442  \n22444442  \n20222228  \n\nThere we have it!",
