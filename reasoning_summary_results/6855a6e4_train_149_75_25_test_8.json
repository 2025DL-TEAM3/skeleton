    "reasoning": "**Mapping pattern rotations**\n\nI need to map unique rows and consider how they rotate around a center. Examples indicate a central symmetric rotation. For instance, in the first input, it looks like the pattern rotates around its center. Input row one shows a change in the position of the digit '4', moving it from the end to the middle, illustrating how the positions are indexed. I\u2019m observing this positional shifting for clarity on rotation behavior.**Mapping symmetrical shifting**\n\nI'm considering a rule where I scan from both ends toward the center, focusing on the two '4s' and moving them inward. It appears they are drawn symmetrically, suggesting a mirroring around the center axis. For example, with a central index of 4.5, I\u2019d move a '4' found in row 1 at column 9 to column 5, and a '4' in row 4 at column 0 to column 4. Rows without '4s' remain unchanged. This inward movement changes how we map values in relation to the center.**Folding shapes to the center**\n\nIn example 3, it looks like the '5' shapes in rows 2 and 3 move toward the center, matching a general rule where the most common color serves as the background. I see that shapes should be concentrated in center columns by moving horizontally inward. In example 1, shapes moved vertically, while in examples 2 and 3, they shifted horizontally. The goal seems to be compressing shapes toward the center, depending on their orientation\u2014compress vertically if arranged along a vertical axis and horizontally if on a horizontal axis.",
