My task is to identify the underlying rule that dictates this transformation, and then apply that same rule to a test input to see if it works consistently. This is an intriguing challenge, and I'm curious to explore the patterns and rules involved to solve it effectively!**Revising input-output grids**\n\nI'm taking a look at this grid transformation example, analyzing the input and output rows. Initially, I'll rewrite them with indices for clarity. The original input had some non-3 numbers, with positions noted for later comparison. \n\nAs I verify, I see the value 4 moved from row0 to row5, and the 1 from row4 now sits in row5. It's interesting to track where these values go, especially with the consistent structure of 3s surrounding them. Let\u2019s keep refining this to fully understand the changes!",
