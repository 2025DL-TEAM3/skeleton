    "reasoning": "**Analyzing mapping patterns**\n\nIt seems that the mapping for zeros isn't uniform. Instead, the first two columns are constant, while the third column has a baseline of 9. Column six seems dependent on an input of 9. So, I think it might be better if I compare example 1 and example 2 side by side. Both examples have constant columns on the left. In example 1, the outputs from columns one and two yield 5, while they yield the same for example 2. However, when analyzing columns three to ten, I notice some discrepancies in the output for different inputs.**Examining mapping variations**\n\nIt looks like the mapping isn't consistent across all columns. It might depend on certain regions, especially with a vertical stripe in column three where the output always echoes 9. For example, in example 1, column three's output remains zero, while example 2 shows a mapping of 0 to 9. I realize example one lacks a case for input 6 in column three, and it always has zeros. In contrast, example two has several nines in the tail positions of its output. So, I'll focus on analyzing this pattern further.**Mapping grid shapes**\n\nIn analyzing the rows, it appears I've mixed up some input values. The rows show distinct shapes, particularly from rows two to six, where I see a prominent area of 4s surrounded by 1s. When outlining the grid, I notice that the border comprises more 1s than 4s, suggesting that 1 is the background color while 4 forms the shape. This leads me to conclude there are two distinct shapes: one composed of 4s and the other comprising 1s in the background.**Replacing numbers in grid**\n\nIn translating the grid values, I've noticed that the background color fills the border, and I need to convert all 1s to 5s while keeping the shape color as 4. Therefore, the output grid should maintain the shape of 4s. When processing each row, I correctly substitute 1s with 5s, leading to the final output. Overall, I generate eight specific rows plus one for the final tally, making it nine rows total, which matches the original input.",
