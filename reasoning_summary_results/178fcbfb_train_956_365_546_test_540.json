    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit grids**\n\nI\u2019m examining a digit-based grid puzzle, focusing on a 7x7 input grid. The input comprises mostly 5's with few other digits\u20142's and 1's. The output shows patterns transforming the predominant 5's into more varied numbers. For example, in certain rows, 5's shift to 2's and 1's, demonstrating a defined structure or rule. My next step is deciphering the consistent rule behind these transformations across the outputs. There\u2019s a lot of interesting data to work through!**Exploring grid patterns**\n\nI'm noticing that the outputs consist of repeated patterns or blocks, especially around the non-5 shapes. For instance, Row 2 turns all into 3's because it originally had a 3. Row 3 and Row 4 have similar behavior with 1's completely filling the outputs. Row 1 shows a transformation where a single 2 shifts positions. It's intriguing that the outputs duplicate certain rows, like Row 5 mirroring Row 1. This suggests a systematic rule based on the location of non-5 digits and their influence on neighboring positions.**Deciphering grid rules**\n\nI'm analyzing the rules for filling in a digit grid based on seed positions. For 1 seeds located at (3,1) and (4,6), I fill the entire rows with 1's. Meanwhile, for 2 seeds scattered across columns, I focus on filling those columns in all remaining rows that lack 1's or 3's. It seems that the filling strategy may depend on how many seeds appear in different rows or columns. Yet, I'm wondering about the consistency of filling in rows versus columns based on those counts. This will likely need more investigation with additional examples to clarify.",
