In Row 1, there's (1,2) with 1 and (1,3) with 5. Row 3 has (3,2) and (3,3) both at 5. Row 4 shows repeat occurrences at (4,2) and (4,3) with 1. I realize that row 2 is completely filled with 2s, creating a gap that distinguishes two clusters formed in rows 0 through 4 around the 2-3 columns. It's intriguing how gaps can define cluster shapes!**Identifying cluster patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing clusters in the grid, particularly focusing on the 2x2 blocks. The top cluster has alternating values of 1 and 5, with a diagonal pattern forming the shape. Notably, the top cluster has both values, while below, there are distinct 5s. I'm visualizing the blocks: the top two clusters are 2x2 rectangles, and the lower cluster consists entirely of 5s. It seems the output effectively matches the established patterns from the connected non-2 blocks. The intention is to capture these structured shapes accurately for further analysis!**Identifying clusters and values**\n\nI'm evaluating color clusters and their counts. The top cluster has two colors, the middle has two, but the bottom only has one, so I\u2019ll disregard the bottom. Both the top and middle clusters are size 4, leading me to select the top based on its position. Moving to the test input, I identify non-2 clusters by checking side adjacency. There are clusters A and B, both of size 4. I'll select cluster A since it\u2019s the leftmost, resulting in the final output grid of:\n\n77  \n11  \n\nIt matches the expected output perfectly!",
