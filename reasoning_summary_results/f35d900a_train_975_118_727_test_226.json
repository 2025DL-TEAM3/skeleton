In comparing the input with the output, it seems that the background number \"1\" in the input transforms predictably into the output. The distances from certain colored pixels, like \"2s,\" seem to play a role in making the output. It looks like there's a symmetry involved, both horizontally and vertically, with those patterns at positions that might represent some continuous shapes. I'll need to delve a bit deeper into understanding those positions.**Identifying patterns in the grid**\n\nI see that the output shows a radial pattern around certain points, particularly the two \"2s\" at positions (1,2) and (7,5). It looks like those values are preserved in the output, and the numbers around them represent a gradient of distances. I'm thinking that I might need to calculate the Manhattan distance from both sources to see how that affects the output values. Additionally, zeros seem to be preserved as well, forming corners of a rectangle in the grid. Overall, it looks like the output is a gradient based on those special values.",
