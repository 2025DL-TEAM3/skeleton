    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input patterns**\n\nIt looks like I'm working with a puzzle involving identifying a repeated shape pattern, possibly a block of 7's. In my analysis, there are colored digits in the input: 6, 0, 9, 5. The first row filled with 9's and the patterns below and above certain numbers are essential. I need to transform and verify output for only the first three rows where 6 appears. Interestingly, while the first few changes match my expectations, there\u2019s an inconsistency with the last 6 when it turns into a 0. I should investigate that further.**Investigating mapping inconsistencies**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that not all 6\u2019s map to 2; only certain positions like 1, 4, and 10 produce that result. It\u2019s puzzling because position 6 turns into zero, which requires a closer look at row 2 where all 6\u2019s do translate to 2. In row 3, however, things get strange with several positions turning to zero. I wonder if these zeros relate to some underlying pattern in the input. Then I switch to analyzing a new grid with 9 rows, where I notice a vertical stripe of 4\u2019s in column 5. I need to break down the input further for clarity.**Examining cluster mapping**\n\nI\u2019m focused on clusters of numbers, particularly in row 2, where I see a cluster of 4 connected horizontally. That\u2019s the largest cluster. Row 3 has several smaller clusters, but they aren\u2019t marked as clearly in the output. The output confirms that row 2 has all 2's in those columns, which matches the mapping for the largest cluster. It seems like only the largest clusters are mapped while smaller ones, like the size 3 clusters, are generally ignored. I\u2019m thinking I need to check cluster sizes and connections more meticulously to understand why some were marked while others were not.**Calculating output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing the input rows and columns to determine clusters of numbers, focusing on non-zero values. Region A shows many occurrences of 7's, so I\u2019ll assign it as color A. Then, I shift my attention to region B, filled with 6's, and color B will be 6. \n\nNext, I need to compute the output based on the mapping between regions. I map corresponding left-side values (7's) with the right-side values (6's) and produce an output grid accordingly. Each output value is derived based on these mappings, which seems to align correctly across all rows and finally results in the expected output format.",
