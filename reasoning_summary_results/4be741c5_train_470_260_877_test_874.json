For the first example, I see a lot of 5s and 9s, leading to an output of 95, indicating a sequence of 9 followed by 5. In the second example, a vertical arrangement reveals a pattern of 9s followed by 0s. The third example shows a graphical shape formed by the digits 2, 8, and 0, producing an overall output of 280. It seems the task involves identifying and reading these shapes and sequences.**Clarifying shape patterns in grids**\n\nI'm plotting example one, where I see a grid filled with digits, specifically 9s and 5s. The output is 95, indicating a sequence that reads the shapes formed by these digits. It seems the task is about identifying contiguous shapes made up of digits, where each shape corresponds to a region filled with a specific digit. The output should represent these regions in the order they appear, either horizontally or vertically. For example, if a grid shows 9s on top and 0s below, the output would reflect that arrangement.**Calculating centroids and output**\n\nI\u2019m calculating the centroids for rows and columns based on the given numbers. For the 5 regions, I find the row and column sums, which lead to means of approximately 3.0 for rows and 5.13 for columns. The arrangement appears horizontal, but my final output should be sorted by column centroid. The result shows the leftmost digit as 9, followed by 5, confirming the expected output of 95. For the test input, I find a vertical arrangement and so the output grid becomes two rows: \n\n9  \n3",
    "test_output_text": "9\n3\n",
    "correct": true
