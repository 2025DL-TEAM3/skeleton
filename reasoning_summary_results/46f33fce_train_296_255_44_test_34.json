    "reasoning": "**Analyzing output mapping**\n\nI'm reasoning through how output rows relate to input rows. I see that there are three identical input rows producing four output rows, with another differing row also resulting in four rows. This suggests they allocate output rows based on a magnification factor \u2014 each input row yields two output rows. However, I\u2019m questioning why three rows produce four and a single row also produces four. So, I should explore the possibility of examining column patterns as well.**Interpreting input to output mapping**\n\nI'm analyzing a specific input row and its corresponding output. The input row has a 9 at position 1, and the output at the bottom is 99992222. It looks like they filled a 4x4 square in the output based on the unique color found in the input. It seems that the bottom-left quadrant of the output reflects this color accurately, forming a block of 9s. I'm also considering how the mapping might have worked in terms of scaling and block formation, which adds complexity to this process.**Understanding magnification in output**\n\nI'm working through how input cells translate to output blocks. It appears they magnified each input cell into larger blocks. In example 1, the factor seems to be 2, while in example 2, they produced an 8x8 output from a 4x4 input, with each block reflecting unique color areas. The unique cell at (3, 1) led to a 4x4 block of 9s in the output's bottom-left quadrant, while other quadrants displayed the majority color of 2s. This approach effectively highlights distinct colors within divided quadrants.**Coloring output quadrants**\n\nI'm exploring how to fill output quadrants based on input. Each output quadrant typically receives its color from the mode of the input quadrant, except for the unique one, which takes on an \"oddball\" color. For instance, in example 2, while the common mode might be 2, the output for the bottom-left quadrant is filled with 9 instead. I want to confirm that the odd quadrant is correctly identified, and the output properly reflects this design. Using another input example helps solidify my understanding. The explanation lays out how quadrants are determined, filled, and scaled \u2014 I think I've clarified this well.",
