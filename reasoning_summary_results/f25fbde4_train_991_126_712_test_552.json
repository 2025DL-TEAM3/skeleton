    "reasoning": "**Calculating bounding boxes and scaling**\n\nSo, I've identified the occurrences of 8s and 5s in the rows. In total, there are 6 eights, mostly located in rows 2 to 4. The positions indicate a bounding rectangle around the 8s, covering rows 2 to 4 and columns 3 to 5. Then, I put together a 3x3 submatrix based on those positions, which gives me a pattern. Now, I'm ready to scale this matrix by a factor of 2, transforming each cell into a 2x2 block.**Building the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m working on creating a 6x6 output grid by scaling up a 3x3 input grid. I\u2019ll map the input cells to specific rows and columns, helping me fill in the values. \n\nFor each input coordinate, I\u2019ll designate the corresponding rows and columns in the output based on that mapping. After completing the grid, I\u2019ll check to ensure all rows have the right length and that the format is correct. \n\nFinally, it looks like the data type remains digits, and I\u2019m ready to present this output:\n```\n885555\n885555\n888888\n888888\n558888\n558888\n```",
