The first column seems to have a lot of 1s, while the second column mostly features 9s, which creates a distinctive pattern. I also want to consider the arrangement of numbers, especially how rows repeat similar sequences.\n\nRegarding colors, I feel the background would emphasize the 9 in the second column. It looks like the main grid structure forms a shape that could add visual interest if rotated. Let's explore how to illustrate this!**Visualizing grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m thinking it's better to visually lay out the grid with column indices. In the first grid, I see a central 3x3 block of zeros surrounding a single 9, creating a clear pattern. The arrangement shows zeros strategically placed around this central number.\n\nIn the second grid, there's another 3x3 frame with zeros encircling a 4, which is interesting. \n\nLastly, the third example showcases a cross shape of 4s in a 3x3 pattern, with a 3 in the center, making it visually distinct too. Exploring these shapes seems fun!**Finding unique 3x3 patterns**\n\nI\u2019m determining a rule for locating 3x3 regions where eight neighbors share the same color. I've analyzed a test input grid and identified that unique border pattern around a different center color.\n\nIn the provided grid, I see a valid pattern centered at (5,4) with zeros surrounding a 1, fitting the criteria. I confirm this as the only pattern because other areas don\u2019t maintain uniform borders. Therefore, the output should be:\n\n000  \n010  \n000  \n\nLooks good!",
