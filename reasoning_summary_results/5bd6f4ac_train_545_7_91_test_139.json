    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI notice the second example starts at row 0, while the third starts at row 1. There's a possible identical 3x3 grid of 888s at row 0. Checking that, I see row 0 columns show all 8s, but the third row doesn\u2019t match. The unique subgrid seems to be at row 1. The rule emerging is to find a 3x3 subgrid where two rows are all 8s, and the last starts with 4. I\u2019m curious about the generic rule across examples, particularly with the first subgrid.**Examining grid patterns**\n\nThe third row has elements 4, 8, and 5, indicating a deviation. In example 1, it shows 4, 8, 5 as well. I\u2019m curious about how many '8's are in the training grid since one '8' is in row 2, col 4. There's a new 032 row in example 2, and I wonder if there are other 3x3 subgrids that contain all colors? The output shows a unique color that isn\u2019t part of a repeated pattern. I see the goal is to isolate the rightmost 3x3 block with a distinct pattern.**Finding unique subgrids**\n\nIt seems like I\u2019m trying to identify 3x3 blocks containing a '4' and possibly one with a unique '8'. The grid contains only one '8' at position (2,4). In example 1, the relevant block includes rows 0-2 and cols 3-5. In example 2, I'm looking for zeros, which appear in several rows but not uniformly. The challenge is to find a subgrid that holds the unique numbers or colors. The output often contains the rightmost or top right block based on distinctiveness.",
