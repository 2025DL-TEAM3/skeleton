    "reasoning": "**Analyzing region boundaries**\n\nI\u2019m examining how region masks are computed, specifically focusing on the rightmost boundary for each row in example 2. For Row 1, the rightmost boundary shows a value of 4, suggesting that the seed value is coming from row 0 instead of the boundary itself, which raises questions about how seeds are chosen in these examples. In example 1, the seed appears to come from row 3. It seems like the original seed is based on the boundary of the non-zero region, which adds an interesting layer to the logic!**Examining region borders**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the connection between region borders and the propagation of values. In example 2, the border of the region of 1's contains zeros that may determine how values expand. I noticed that the cells above these borders serve as seeds for filling downwards. It seems that for the target region, values are copied from the border cells, preserving their order. In example 1, the propagation also happens horizontally, further confirming this behavior. The outputs do match my expectations based on the borders.**Assessing region and border interactions**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how the output is determined in relation to borders and regions. In row 6, values in columns 2 to 5 are set to 8 based on the adjacent border value from column 5, despite it not being part of the input region itself. It seems that the algorithm fills region cells with the nearest non-zero neighbor\u2019s value, preserving borders. This pattern continues into row 7, where the algorithm uses nearby non-zero cells to fill in regions while maintaining border integrity. This consistent approach seems to apply across different examples too.**Exploring region filling algorithm**\n\nI\u2019m examining how to fill a region based on its borders and the orientation of its shape. In the example, the fill values come from the neighboring border cells. It seems the algorithm identifies the region of a uniform color and samples from the nearest non-background pixels outside that region. For example, in the third example, the filling uses values from the downward border.\n\nI\u2019ve seen that by determining the non-zero neighbors in suitable directions, the algorithm fills the region based on those borders. This requires considering each direction to maintain consistent fill across the shape.",
