With an input size of 7x5, the output dimensions match as 6x4 when using a 2x2 sliding window\u2014great! Testing further, an input of 5x3 gives an unexpected output of 2x2 rows instead of the anticipated 4x2. I'm wondering if they only printed a partial subgrid. In the second example with 2x5, the output of \"63\" appears to truncate expected columns. There might be different rules for these examples.**Analyzing output logic**\n\nI'm digging into the output logic of the sliding 2x2 blocks. For uniform blocks, like (0s) or ones with no majority (like in block2), the output is 0. But in other blocks, like (1,3), the color with the highest frequency instead shows up. It seems like there\u2019s no consistent rule for determining the outputs, which makes it tricky! I\u2019m noticing patterns: the output rows form a clearer structure. For example, if there\u2019s equality in counts, they might opt for the outlier. I'll need to compute the full output grid.**Interpreting output rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how to determine outputs from various blocks in the input grid. For instance, in some cases, blocks with 2x2 arrangements result in specific values based on their unique counts. It seems blocks must involve some variation or non-uniformity to prompt an output. A potential rule could be that if the top-left and bottom-right values match, the block is skipped; otherwise, the top-left value is outputted. I'll keep exploring the outputs and the rules while checking input variations for consistency, but some contradictions arise with the provided examples.",
