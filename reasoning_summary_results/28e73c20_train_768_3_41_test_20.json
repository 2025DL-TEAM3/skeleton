    "reasoning": "**Deciphering transformation rules**\n\nI need to figure out the transformation rules from the provided examples. In each example, the input grids of digits lead to output grids with the same shape but different values. It looks like most cells are replaced with '3', except for some that preserve their original value or change the last digit to '3.\u2019 \n\nFor example, in the first row, all digits turn to '3', while in the second row, the first eight digits stay the same, and only the last one changes. I wonder why specific cells get preserved.**Analyzing input-output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m diving into the second example, which consists of 6 rows and 7 columns. I notice that specific patterns in the input seem to dictate the output values. For instance, in Row 2, the input \"8884444\" results in \"8884443,\" where only the last digit changes. \n\nSimilarly, Row 4's input \"4884884\" leads to a mix of preserved and altered digits. It seems rows with certain frequent patterns maintain specific digits, suggesting there might be a symmetry involved. I\u2019m curious to identify these \"active\" columns based on their occurrences!**Identifying shape patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how the digits in the grid form specific shapes, particularly focusing on the digit '8' as a potential marker. It seems like when we have background color, most other cells become '3', while only '8's are preserved as part of identifiable shapes. \n\nIn the second example, I notice how '8's help form a connected cluster. Rows with more '8's maintain their structure while rows considered noise get eliminated. It's striking how some rows, like Row 2, get preserved nearly intact, indicating they hold the key to identifying the shape across the grid.**Determining output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m noticing a pattern in the grid output, especially with row preservation. For instance, in my test with a 4-row grid, the second row keeps its values, except the last column, which changes to '3.' In the third row, only the column at the width minus one position is preserved, while others turn to '3'. \n\nCombining these rules gives me a consistent output for all rows. It seems I've validated my deductions adequately, and I'm confident in presenting this final output!",
