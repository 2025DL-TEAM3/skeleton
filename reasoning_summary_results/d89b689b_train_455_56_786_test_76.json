    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformation**\n\nI'm looking at an example with an input grid and its corresponding output. The first row showcases changes where values differ, like '1' turning into '6' and '0' becoming '6.' In the second row, the '9s' are replaced by a '1' and a '0.' The third row is similar, with '9' changing to '8' and '3.' It seems the output involves modifying the input values according to specific rules. I'm curious about how this transformation is applied uniformly across rows!**Understanding digit transformation**\n\nIn the analysis of the grid, I see that the values in Row 6, specifically '8' and '3,' are replaced with '6.' This hints at '6' being the dominant digit across the input. The majority rule suggests filling most positions with '6' while swapping out specific ones. I notice isolated digits, like '1' and '0,' as well as a 2x2 cluster of '9s' that was transformed in a specific mapping. I need to preserve their original order while translating them into the output grid.**Deciphering grid transformation rules**\n\nI\u2019m working through grid transformations. My goal is to figure out how to replace values based on specific sorting rules. I believe I need to analyze the positions of non-dominant digits within their bounding boxes to organize them correctly. For instance, I see that within sources, positions are classified by their quadrants, mapping to a target rectangle. \n\nNow, examining the latest input revealed some other digits that could be sources, leading to placements that seem to align correctly with the expected outputs!**Mapping source values in grid**\n\nI\u2019m working on a 5x5 grid to identify the background color based on frequency, which turns out to be 4. I\u2019ve found non-4 positions that create a rectangular cluster of 2s. I need to map the sources to this target block while classifying them based on their relative positions. \n\nAfter identifying each source's quadrant, I\u2019m placing them in the target grid and replacing their original positions with the background color, generating the final structured output!",
