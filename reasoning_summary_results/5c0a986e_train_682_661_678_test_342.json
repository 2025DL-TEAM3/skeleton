    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle transformations**\n\nI'm diving into an ARC puzzle that involves transforming grids of digits. The first example shows an input and an output. In the output, I can see specific changes in the digits, particularly in the first and fourth rows. In the first row, one digit changes from 7 to 1, while the fourth row has several digits transforming from 7 to 2. It looks like I need to identify which indices change across the rows and deduce a pattern for the transformation. Let's keep going!**Mapping clusters in the grid**\n\nI'm examining a grid to identify clusters of 1s and 2s. The first cluster consists of 1s located at row 2, columns 7-8 and row 3, columns 7-8, forming a 2x2 square. I see changes in surrounding cells, particularly row 1, column 6, which changed to 1 based on a neighbor above, and row 5, column 6, which appears as 2. I need to clarify these clusters and their transformations while ensuring to map each position correctly. Let's keep analyzing!**Identifying transformations in clusters**\n\nI'm analyzing clusters in a grid focused on values 2 and 1. Cluster B consists of a 2x2 block at locations (2,4), (2,5), (3,4), and (3,5), where changes occur to neighbors. The bottom-left and left neighbors of this block get specific extensions, while Cluster A remains unchanged. I\u2019m noticing that extensions only happen for clusters not confined by borders, and the corner of these shapes plays a key role in where changes occur. Now, I\u2019ll apply this method to the next example.**Analyzing cluster modifications**\n\nI'm looking into how to modify clusters based on their values. For the block of value '2', I'm considering diagonal fills, especially for cluster B, which consists of two separate blocks. It seems like both diagonal corners of cluster B are filled, while cluster A only filled one of its diagonals. I realize there may be a rule where only the bottom-right diagonal neighbor gets filled for clusters of '2'. I'll ensure I follow this pattern for my final output, keeping the changes consistent.",
