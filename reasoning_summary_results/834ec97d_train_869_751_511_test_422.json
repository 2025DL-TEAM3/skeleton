    "reasoning": "**Exploring the pattern changes**\n\nI see they replaced a region with a checkerboard pattern of size 5x5 in rows 1-5, showing multiple rows of 47474. However, row 6 is a different value, 77776, which raises questions\u2014was there an error in the output? Maybe they aimed to fill a border around the block, expanding uniformly. If I generalize from the example given, expanding the borders works, filling circumstances based on checkerboard logic, starting with 4 for row 1. It's fascinating to consider!**Analyzing row expansions**\n\nI'm noticing a pattern in how rows are expanded in these examples. In example one, they added just one row above the block. In example two, they seem to have expanded a 5x5 block and added a checkerboard pattern across six rows, while leaving any anomalies untouched below. Then in example three, there's a focus on contiguous rows where one row could become two with a similar checkerboard pattern. The algorithm is about finding the largest uniform block and replacing it with an alternating pattern. It's all quite fascinating!**Understanding row transformations**\n\nIt looks like they added only one new checkerboard row at the top instead of replacing the whole block. In example one, they kept the original rows intact, but in examples two and three, they replaced entire blocks. Example two shows that they replaced five rows with six new ones. When checking example three, I see the largest consistent regions, but the handling of anomalies seems to differ. I wonder if they filled boxes to address those anomalies instead, as changes reflect an intriguing pattern!**Clarifying anomaly handling**\n\nI think the anomaly row is positioned based on available space, moving downwards when more rows are beneath. For instance, in example one, it moved down to row two. The process appears to favor upward movement when space above is constrained. The rule seems consistent: the row with the anomaly shifts down, while the new rows above incorporate an alternating pattern. In all cases, I see that when anomalies are integrated, remaining rows may be dropped, reinforcing the importance of determining majority values throughout the grid.",
