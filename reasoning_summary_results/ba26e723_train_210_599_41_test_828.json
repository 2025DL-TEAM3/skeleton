    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC task involving grids of digits, possibly string representations of rows. I see input examples like \"8008\", leading to outputs like \"6006.\" It seems the rule might involve adding or subtracting values from different digits. For instance, the first row's 8 becomes 6, while the second row's 3 changes to 6. It looks like I need to identify consistent transformations across columns to grasp the rules clearly. There\u2019s some inconsistency, so I need to analyze it more!**Exploring grid transformations**\n\nIn analyzing the first column, I notice that if digits are not zero, they can transform such as 3 and 2 becoming 6, while 0 remains unchanged. The second puzzle shows transitions like 5 changing to 6, while zeros stay as is. However, there's inconsistency when 9 transforms into 6 sometimes, but remains 9 in cases like \"090.\" I\u2019m considering that the background color of the grid may affect these transformations, suggesting an advanced rule for modifying digits based on their positions!**Unpacking transformation rules**\n\nI'm comparing three examples with different grid sizes. Within each, the number of lines varies, but the output remains consistent, suggesting a global transformation rule. In the first example, I notice that non-zero values in the first and last columns change to 6, while zeros stay the same. In the second example, I see similar patterns where specific digits change based on their positions. I suspect a rule where the first non-zero digit in each row may convert to 6, depending on its position. I need to refine this to confirm!",
