    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid generation**\n\nIt seems like I'm working on generating a larger grid from a smaller input. For instance, taking a 3x3 input matrix and creating a 9x9 output by using it as a macro grid of 3x3 blocks. Each of these blocks contains the original input numbers, which are padded to reach a total length of 9 characters. I need to make sure to align the blocks correctly. The rows in the output are built by placing input rows and filling in zeros where necessary. Let\u2019s clarify this to get it right.**Clarifying block dimensions**\n\nI\u2019m working with blocks from a 3x2 input that replicates into a 3x3 macrogrid. The output dimensions seem tricky; I see it outputs four columns, meaning the macrogrid should be two blocks wide, but with nine rows. Each output contains a pattern where some blocks repeat inputs and others use zeros. \n\nIn analyzing this, it looks like the layout may form a sort of T or L shape, suggesting a masking pattern that reflects the original input structure. I\u2019ll need to check the examples more closely.**Detailing the output rows**\n\nIn analyzing the output rows, I notice that rows are filled based on how blocks incorporate the original input. For instance, the first three rows contain variations of input padded with zeros. \n\nIn subsequent rows, it looks like the blocks start to populate from inputs, specifically taking from earlier rows. The structure reflects a pattern similar to previous examples; overall, it\u2019s about correctly laying out the digits in a 9x9 grid. I\u2019ll ensure I maintain this formatting while matching the original input structure.",
