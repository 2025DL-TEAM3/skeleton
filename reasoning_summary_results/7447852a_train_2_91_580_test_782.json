    "reasoning": "**Analyzing numeric patterns**\n\nThis puzzle seems to involve transforming grids based on a numeric rule. In the first training block, numbers change at specific positions: the last digit changes from 8 to 4 in the first row, the first digit from 8 to 4 in the second, and the first two digits from 88 to 44 in the third. In the second block, wherever there's a 7, certain positions shift to 4. There\u2019s an interesting pattern to uncover here!**Unpacking the transformation rule**\n\nIn the second block, I noticed the pattern where each row's zeros dictate changes. For example, in Row 2, the zero at position 1 changes the preceding 7 to 4. Similarly, in Row 3, the zero at position 2 causes the first two 7s to transform into 4s. This continues for each row, replacing all 7s before the first zero with 4. The last row shows a clear output of 4444440777, confirming the rule applies consistently across all inputs.**Detecting digit replacement patterns**\n\nIn analyzing the first block, I observe a pattern involving replacing 8s based on their position related to the digit 1. For example, in the input \"198818,\" only the last 8 changes to 4. This indicates a rule about the placement of 8s relative to 1s, suggesting that they focus on replacements either left or right of the first occurrence of 1. Exploring further, Row 2 changes the single 8 to 4. However, Row 3 shows two 8s changed, which complicates the rule. The inconsistency invites thoughts about potentially targeting digit sums or patterns; ideally, I'll keep refining my understanding!**Evaluating pivot digit rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how to determine which digits are replaced based on identified pivot digits across various rows. The rule seems consistent: replace digits before the pivot. Looking closely, in several rows, the first non-zero digit becomes the pivot. It's interesting that applying the rule of changing all digits before the pivot impacts outputs in different ways, depending on whether the pivot is unique or the first occurrence. I\u2019ll continue testing this approach while considering the overall consistency of outputs for different inputs!**Analyzing pivot rules**\n\nI\u2019m considering the idea that the pivot digit is always located on the diagonal of the matrix, where all preceding cells in the same row change to 4. For instance, if the pivot is 1 in block 1, no prior cells change in row 0, which seems puzzling since the output differs slightly from expectation. However, applying this rule consistently to all rows leads to outputs where each previous cell before the pivot is changed accordingly. I'll finalize the expected outputs based on this pivot rule!",
