I didn't find any 8s in the previous rows, but I maintain the rule of swapping. Now I\u2019ll apply this to a new grid, replacing 5s with 8s, and vice versa, across all rows and columns.**Rewriting digit rows**\n\nI'm going through each row and swapping the digits according to the rule: I'll replace 5s with 8s and vice versa. For instance, Row 1 changes from \"6 5 5 5\" to \"6 8 8 8.\" I\u2019ll carry this out for all rows, continuing to ensure the output matches the style of a digit string. The final output grid looks like this:\n\n6888\n6866\n6686\n6866\n6888\n8665\n6666\n6888\n8886\n\nI\u2019ll double-check to ensure everything is correct; it looks good!",
