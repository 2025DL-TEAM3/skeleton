    "reasoning": "**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m examining how the input gets repeated into a 4x4 grid. The initial input is 89 and 99. When laid out, it reveals a pattern that isn\u2019t just simple tiling; it includes padding with zeros in the top-left quadrant. So, the output appears as:  \nRow 0 has two sections of input, but it actually starts with zeros. The final rows incorporate the input in a structured way: rows 2 and 3 show the actual numbers tiled. It effectively demonstrates an interesting method of constructing the output grid.**Examining quadrant organization**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how input forms quadrants in a matrix. The top-left 2x2 quadrant is filled with zeros, while the other three quadrants replicate the original input. It seems that the bottom quadrants maintain the original input values. \n\nWhen analyzing a 3x3 input example, the output expands into a 9x9 grid organized into blocks. The zeros appear diagonally, carefully mapped out based on the input's structure. It's intriguing how these quadrants and their placements create visually distinct patterns!**Constructing output grid**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to structure the output grid based on the input. For row 1, I repeat the pattern to get 979797, while row 2 gives me 777777. The blocks consist of zeros and the repeated input, combining these patterns to create rows in a way that flows logically. As I combine and verify rows, everything aligns well, and I\u2019m treating zeros as significant.\n\nWhen checking against similar examples, everything seems consistent, leading to a final grid output that looks clear and complete. It's exciting to see it all come together!",
