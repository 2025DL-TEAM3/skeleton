    "reasoning": "**Parsing puzzle data**\n\nThis is an ARC puzzle focused on border invariance and modifications within. For the training data, I\u2019m examining how the 8x7 matrix operates with fixed borders while changes happen in the center. The first and last rows and columns remain unchanged, confirming my analysis of the borders. Moving to the inner 6x5 grid, I\u2019m noting the transformation of the second row for a clearer mapping. The original to output data changes, which I find intriguing.**Mapping grid transformations**\n\nI\u2019m working on an input-output mapping for a grid, specifically focusing on the interior from rows 2 to 7 and columns 2 to 6. I see that I need to analyze how numbers change from input to output. For instance, the second row changes an 8 to a 2 and 2s remain mostly unchanged in various rows. There seems to be a pattern where certain numbers convert to match the border colors. I\u2019m also curious about how numbers like 4 fluctuate or stay the same, indicating an underlying rule.**Analyzing shape movement**\n\nI'm considering how to move shapes toward the center based on color counts. Initially, I thought each shape might move inward based on the color's prevalence in its area. However, I now think the shapes could use a Manhattan-style approach, moving until they collide\u2014preserving their order.  \n\nI need to figure out patterns in the training examples, particularly what behaviors govern the colors. It seems that colors appearing more than once are preserved, while those appearing less are removed. The movement patterns might involve moving clusters of colors that are sufficiently connected.**Determining output grid**\n\nI\u2019ve decided that a threshold of around 72.5% triggers a fill, and my calculated value of 73.2% fits that criteria. This leads to a uniform zero interior in the output grid. I\u2019ve formatted the grid as follows:\n\n```\n066666660\n100000009\n100000009\n100000009\n100000009\n100000009\n100000009\n100000009\n100000009\n022222220\n```\n\nI confirm that the rows replace the interior correctly with zeros. It feels like a solid potential answer, though I wonder about an alternative with a central line of zeros. For now, I\u2019ll stick with this version.",
