    "reasoning": "**Analyzing pattern inference**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle that requires pattern inference to solve. There are three input pairs made up of three rows, leading to an output of nine rows, arranged in a 3x3 pattern. From the first example, I observe how the output echoes the input, showing a clear tiling pattern with some flipping involved. Each block seems to maintain the width of the input, focusing on a vertical arrangement rather than horizontal. I'll map rows accordingly to maintain clarity in the output structure.**Reflecting row patterns**\n\nI'm realizing that the output rows are repeating based on a specific sequence from the input rows. Each output line reflects a vertical pattern, moving through the input rows in a sequence: starting from the first row, going down to the last, and then back up. For instance, with an input of three rows, the output forms a mirror-like pattern: row indices follow the sequence 0,1,2,1,0,1,2,1,0. So, for the given input, I just need to repeat this pattern for the output.**Generating output rows**\n\nGiven the rows, I have row0 as \"777777777,\" row1 as \"000777771,\" and row2 also as \"777777777.\" The output pattern develops by alternating between row1 and row0. This results in nine rows: starting with row0, then row1, and continuing to repeat row0 and row1 in an alternating fashion. \n\nSo, the final output is simply:\n\n777777777  \n000777771  \n777777777  \n000777771  \n777777777  \n000777771  \n777777777  \n000777771  \n777777777  \n\nThat confirms the pattern is correct!",
