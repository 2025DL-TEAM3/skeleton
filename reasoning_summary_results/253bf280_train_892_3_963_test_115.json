It seems like I\u2019m changing some digits, possibly influenced by counts of neighbors or something similar. The first training input has 10 rows and each is about 7 digits long, with colors 2 and 8. I\u2019ll dig deeper to understand how these elements interact!**Rewriting the training input**\n\nI'm rewriting the first training input for clarity. The rows consist of a mix of 2s and 8s, with specific changes in certain columns. For instance, the second row has a 3 replacing a 2 in column 4, and similar changes ripple through the rows according to some underlying pattern. It seems that values shift based on the positions of the 8s, which create distinct clusters. I'll trace these 8s' coordinates and analyze whether they form notable shapes within the input. Let's see how they cluster together!**Finalizing the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m detailing the output rows based on the changes I made. The first two rows remain unchanged, while in Row 3, I\u2019ve modified column 4 from 4 to 3, resulting in \"4443444744.\u201d Row 4 also has changes in column 4, while Row 5 is similar to Row 4. For Row 6, column values stay the same, and Rows 7 to 9 don\u2019t change at all. After carefully checking all my adjustments, I\u2019ve confirmed everything looks good.
