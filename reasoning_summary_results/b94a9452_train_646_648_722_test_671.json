The input has a 4 in the ignored left section, specifically at row 2, column 1, which is confusing. It seems like they insert this 4 into the output grid but update that position to 9 at row 1, column 1. So output row 1, column 1 has a 9 now? Let me clarify the example to make sense of this better.**Clarifying mapping and inversion**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how they transformed the input colors, especially around the 4 and 9. It looks like instead of reproducing the 4, they inserted a 9, and it seems like they invert colors while keeping a specific cell. I need to identify which rows and columns are involved. I think they ignored some border rows and columns, changing some colors along the way. I\u2019ll focus on how they defined the color mappings \u2014 there\u2019s definitely a pattern here that I need to uncover more clearly.**Mapping color transformations**\n\nI'm wrestling with how they handle color replacements in the example. It seems they replace everything in a certain region with 3, but keep the original 3s as 0. However, output row 1, column 4 doesn't seem to match expectations. I suspect the effective region may be different, possibly limiting it to certain columns. I think they might be using a bounding box around non-border colors, then inverting the colors inside that rectangle to create the output. Let's clarify the bounding areas more thoroughly.",
