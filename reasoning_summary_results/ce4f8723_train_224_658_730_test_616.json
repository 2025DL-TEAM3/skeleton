In the first example, I have 9 input rows, each resulting in a 3-digit output \u2014 interesting! The next examples follow a similar pattern, with 8 input rows leading to 8 outputs of 4 digits each. It seems the number of input rows directly relates to the output rows.\n\nI'm curious to figure out the rule that connects each input row to its corresponding output, specifically focusing on counting something within those numbers. Let's take a closer look!**Exploring the mapping rule**\n\nI'm trying to determine if the output relates to the frequency of digits in each input row. For example, the output \"333\" might suggest that the digit 3 appears frequently, but that's not the case in the input rows. \n\nI\u2019m considering if the inputs form a grid structure, where each row might represent a connected component. Each input row compresses into a shorter output, so I'm thinking there might be a direct mapping where outlier colors or specific patterns define the outputs. \n\nAs I've analyzed the first example row by row, the outputs are predominantly 3 or 7, which hints at a deeper rule. I wonder how the predominant digit influences the output and if there\u2019s something about the arrangement that leads to these specific numbers.",
