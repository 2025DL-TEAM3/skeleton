The input only consists of the digits 5 and 6, while the output uses just 0 and 6. It seems like the output digit 6 appears based on a condition involving neighboring cells. I wonder if it's detecting patterns like 2x2 blocks or some kind of morphological transformation indicating certain positions. I\u2019ll need to dig deeper into this pattern detection!**Annotating the grid transformation**\n\nI'm looking at the grid transformation example with 4 rows and 6 columns. For each row, if the input has a 5, the output position will show a 6; otherwise, it shows a 0. \n\nSo, for instance, Row 1 has a 5 in column 3, which turns into a 6 in the output. I'll need to double-check my understanding: it seems like I might\u2019ve confused some positions. The rule likely is to mark positions where the input digit equals the smallest in that row, specifically converting 5s to 6s and keeping 6s as 0s. Now I'll move on to testing with a new example!",
