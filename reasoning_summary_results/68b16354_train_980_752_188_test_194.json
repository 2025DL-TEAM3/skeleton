In the first example, the two rows simply swapped, indicating they might be sorted by a certain criterion. In the second example, the output starts with the last input row and goes backward. For the test input, I have four rows and need to output them in reverse order. So, I'd output: 8968, 9889, 8898, 2962. I don't see any other transformations needed here.**Finalizing output**\n\nSo, the output I've got is: \n\n8968  \n9889  \n8898  \n2962  \n\nThat's the answer, clear and straightforward. I wonder if there\u2019s anything else to consider, like if the whole numbers fit the width requirement. Each row has a consistent width of 4, which seems fine. I don\u2019t see any other transformations needed, so I\u2019m concluding here as everything aligns with the instructions!",
