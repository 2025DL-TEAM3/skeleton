    "reasoning": "**Analyzing sequence patterns**\n\nThe sequence 8,8,9,4,3, when reversed, becomes 3,4,9,8,8. However, the output shows 4,3 at the front instead of simply reversing. For row 2 with 8,8,9,7,2, the output has the unique elements 7 and 2 first, indicating a rearrangement. The first two 8s are moved to the end, so the new order is 7,2,9,8,8. This suggests a pattern where group elements are repositioned. It seems the final transformation can be generalized as moving patterns around.**Evaluating group rotations**\n\nI'm analyzing how to categorize element groups in sequences, starting with identifying contiguous groups. For instance, in the sequence 8,8,9,4,3: group 1 is 8,8, group 2 is the solitary 9, and group 3 consists of 4,3. Rotating these groups gives me group 3 first and group 1 last, leading to a specific output order. In different rows, I examine repeating elements and how they fit into central or background roles, which impacts how I interpret the output transformations. It's interesting how shifting these groups changes what I see!**Understanding row transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing the outputs of example 2 and trying to align them with their inputs. For instance, input rows 4 and 5 are both 99699, which remain unchanged in the output. I notice that output rows 1 and 2 come from these unchanged rows. However, output row 4, which is 99659, doesn\u2019t directly match its input, leading me to believe there\u2019s a transformation happening based on the majority element in each group. It looks like identifying and rotating these elements establishes the patterns I\u2019m seeing. It's fascinating how the arrangement works!**Mapping cluster movements**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how shapes in a training example transition between clusters. The bottom-left cluster (Q3) uses a horizontal stripe from the top-left (Q2), indicating shape movement. I\u2019m determining new output positions for these shapes based on their respective initial positions. For each shape moved from Q2 to Q3, I predict where they'll appear based on changes in their row positioning. After this, I create a new output grid, establishing stripes and backgrounds, ensuring empty spaces show as backgrounds. Ultimately, the output reflects these transformations clearly!",
