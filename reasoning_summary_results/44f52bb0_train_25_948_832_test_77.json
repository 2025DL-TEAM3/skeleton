Row 1 is a palindrome, as well as Rows 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. This indicates vertical symmetry. However, in the first example, 7817 doesn't reverse to itself\u2014it's not palindromic. But it does maintain symmetry when rotated 180 degrees. So, I've confirmed the rows exhibit palindromic properties for symmetry!**Checking symmetry in grids**\n\nI'm analyzing grid1 which consists of 8 rows to determine if there's symmetry both vertically and horizontally. Each row pairs match up, confirming horizontal symmetry. When I check the columns, they also prove to be palindromic, indicating vertical symmetry. So, grid1 is symmetric across both axes. Moving to example2, its rows and columns show the same symmetrical properties. For example3, while there\u2019s vertical symmetry, it lacks horizontal symmetry. It's interesting that all outputs are \"1,\" which might indicate a general confirmation of symmetry, while \"0\" could mean asymmetry. Now, checking the test grid's first row reveals it is indeed symmetric vertically!**Analyzing palindrome symmetry**\n\nI'm checking each row for palindrome properties, and it turns out all rows from Row 2 to Row 10 are indeed palindromes, confirming vertical symmetry. However, when comparing Row 1 to Row 10, I find that Row 1 isn't symmetric horizontally. This means the grid only has vertical symmetry, matching previous training examples which also output \"1\" under these conditions. So, the rule seems to be that if there\u2019s symmetry along any axis, the output is \"1\". Given that, I\u2019ll summarize the output as just \"1\".",
