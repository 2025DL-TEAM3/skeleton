I've input some rows and their inverted patterns look interesting. I\u2019m considering using an overlay filter with techniques like erosion or dilation. This could involve sliding a smaller window over the input to identify and summarize patterns, but I'm not quite sure how to break down the inputs effectively just yet. There's a lot to sort through!**Exploring anomaly mapping**\n\nI'm examining how to process a 7x7 input of mostly 6's and 3's to produce a smaller 4x3 output. I represent 6 as background and 3 as anomalies. The anomaly map reveals certain patterns, and I note that the output retains the 6 background and 3 anomalies. I\u2019m considering removing rows and columns of all zeros to see how that affects the dimensions. I\u2019ve identified some columns that are entirely zeros, which could affect my final output significantly. Let's keep refining!",
