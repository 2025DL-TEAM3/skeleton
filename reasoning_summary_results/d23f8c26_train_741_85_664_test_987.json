The first two examples involve rows and columns, leading to all zeros or specific patterns based on neighboring digits. The latest input has four rows and three columns. I'm considering the pattern that might involve identifying positions with three or more neighboring '8's. Let's explore how that rule can apply to this new input!**Identifying expansion patterns**\n\nI'm exploring a potential rule regarding how outputs transform based on input grids. In Example 2, when examining the changes, it seems that numbers surrounded by at least two '8's are becoming '8's themselves. This might resemble a kind of morphological dilation, where the presence of '8's expands their influence to neighboring cells. I\u2019m mapping where these '8's are and noticing that they expand contiguous regions, replacing non-'8' numbers in certain contexts. This suggests that any adjacent (4-neighbor) cell to an '8' will also change to an '8'.**Determining transformation rules**\n\nI'm trying to identify the rules for transforming input grids based on their patterns. It looks like the method involves checking for contiguous digits in columns and rows. If a number has at least two identical neighboring digits, it may turn into that number. There's an interesting balance between row and column rules, where frequencies are considered, and preservation of unique digits also comes into play. Essentially, if a digit is prevalent in both its row and column, it remains unchanged, while others are replaced. It's a complex mix of operations!**Evaluating output rules**\n\nIn Example 2, it seems like the output involves dilating shapes of '8's by considering neighboring cells. For the test input, I\u2019m analyzing various positions and how dilation would expand from those points. However, there\u2019s some inconsistency across examples, which complicates things. Given that the test input is symmetrical and only contains ones, I think I should output it identically, as all values are uniform without any zeros to remove. It feels straightforward but following the previous patterns has proved tricky.",
