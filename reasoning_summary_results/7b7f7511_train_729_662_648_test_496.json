    "reasoning": "**Identifying row patterns**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about the input grid, where each row consists of 9 digits. The pattern is two rows that repeat: first row, then second row, and back again. My goal here is to output just the first occurrence of each row. It seems like each row could be treated as a string, with the individual digits representing the cells. So for the example given, I understand that rows one and two are distinct, while rows three and four just repeat them.**Determining row outputs**\n\nSo, the output consists of the first two rows: \n\n4140542636  \n4447444489  \n\nIn another scenario, I considered splitting each 10-digit string into two halves. However, since those halves are not identical, the repetition occurs in the entire rows, not the halves themselves. \n\nIn the second example, I see some rows repeat, like \"994994\" in rows one and four, while others are unique. It confirms that in this context, only certain rows are duplicated, and they didn\u2019t drop duplicates but truncated them to the first three digits.**Defining grid outputs**\n\nI'm determining how to output the first five rows based on whether the grid repeats vertically or horizontally. If there's vertical repetition, I just keep the top half. For example, in one case, the rows repeat, so I remove duplicates and only show the first half. If the repetition is horizontal, I trim the right half. In the case given, I've identified a vertical repetition, so I'll output the first half rows:\n\n4140542636  \n4447444489",
