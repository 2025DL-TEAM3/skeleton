    "reasoning": "**Analyzing color transformations**\n\nI'm thinking about how certain shapes and colors are transformed. It seems like the training examples focus on encoding numeric contexts. I wonder if this might involve counting contiguous segments of a specific digit per row. For instance, with input like 00200000, I see runs of two zeros and two more later. The output appears to represent these counts, indicating that the patterns are consistent. However, could it also mean counting non-zeros in each column? It\u2019s a bit tricky to figure out!**Investigating grid outputs**\n\nI'm analyzing the grid, starting with the example rows like Row1: 00200000. I notice that at Row1, Col2 (value=2), the non-zero counts below it (Rows 2, 3, and 4) are also 2, which makes me think there are three occurrences overall. However, the output at Row1, Col2 is 1, which seems off.\n\nI wonder if we're actually counting connected blocks instead? Maybe the largest output number is a distance to the nearest zero because looking at Row4 (from 69238751) results in a consistent pattern. I realize I might need to reassess the mapping for another example, particularly in terms of identifying unique digits and their respective positions.**Exploring mapping complexities**\n\nI\u2019m realizing the mapping for this example seems more complex than I initially thought. For instance, if row 6 maps 2 to 2, but my assumption is it should map to 3, I might need to reorder unique additions. Maybe a different scanning order could clarify this, like looking at columns rather than rows. It\u2019s possible that the puzzle involves replacing each non-zero digit by its rank among non-zeros in its column. \n\nI should check distinct values and their rank for each column to see if that holds true. The idea of examining connected components based on their sizes and mapping them accordingly also stands out. In the example, colors that are connected should maintain the same color in the output. It looks like shapes of consistent size could indeed be matched to the same output color.**Analyzing shape mapping**\n\nI\u2019m looking into the mapping for shapes based on their size and how they correspond to values in the grid. For example, I noted that a size 9 shape corresponds to code 1, while a size 5 shape gets code 2. It appears the output is consistent with this mapping.\n\nNext, I'm analyzing example 3, checking for connected shapes and determining their sizes. I see that there are two distinct clusters of the number 7, and I\u2019m figuring out their sizes to assign appropriate codes. It seems I\u2019ll need to sort unique shapes by size to map them correctly to new colors. All these steps get me closer to understanding the total logic!",
