For instance, with an input of 8x10, removing 4 rows and 4 columns gives a 4x6 output. Similarly, from 10x10 to 6x6, and from 6x8 to 2x4. So the general rule is to remove a 2-cell border around the input. Now, I need to figure out how to calculate the values for the interior cells!**Investigating output calculations**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out how the output grid corresponds to something like a 4x6 interior. For this, I need to explore how the counts within a neighborhood or shape might work. For the simpler example of a 6x8 grid going down to 2x4, I'll focus on the relevant rows and columns after removing borders. \n\nAfter examining the input and removing the necessary rows and columns, I see the output rows don't match directly with simple extractions. It seems like there's a function involved, maybe counting occurrences in the neighborhood or something similar. This requires further analysis to clarify how the detailed output is determined.**Analyzing distance transformations**\n\nI\u2019m reflecting on the patterns in various examples, identifying the binary matrices. For instance, in example 1, the interior consists of 1's and 0's. The goal seems to be recognizing shapes within and calculating distances from each interior position to the nearest filled cell or boundary.\n\nFor example, in analyzing the output of example 1, the output values correlate to distances from 0s to the nearest 1. I think a distance transform is needed, possibly requiring adjustments based on surrounding border values to maintain consistency throughout the output. It feels like I need to explore connected components of zeros further to ensure accurate calculations.",
