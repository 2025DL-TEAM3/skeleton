The output grid changes to have a pattern primarily of 8s, with some 9s showing up based on a defined arrangement. I'll detail how each row is transformed clearly. It's an intriguing puzzle!**Exploring grid patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a rectangle filled with a uniform value and an anomaly at a specific corner. The general rule seems to be that the anomaly's value appears in a diagonal pattern, except at rows following a specific distance rule. \n\nIn my example, the anomaly, a 9, is located at the bottom right, and as I filled out the grid, I noticed the 9 forms a diamond shape when plotted. It's interesting how the values mirror symmetrically around this anomaly! I think this helps simplify tracking similar patterns in future puzzles.",
