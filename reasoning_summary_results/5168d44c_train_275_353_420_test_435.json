    "reasoning": "**Examining block transformation**\n\nThis task seems focused on transforming colored blocks, specifically in grids where certain sections are filled with digits like 8s, 7s, and 4s. I'll analyze a sample input where colors expand or fill certain areas. In Sample 1, I see a 3x3 block of 4s potentially centered around the coordinate (5,3). The goal appears to involve reflecting or expanding these colored regions. I'm curious how this transformation works as I explore the patterns!**Identifying the grid transformation**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the sample input, focusing on the placement of 4s and 7s. In rows 4-6, certain 4s and 7s change, but 7s remain in position. The output seems to replace 4s with 8s while keeping the 7s intact. I noticed that the overall structure forms a cross shape of 4s with one 7 at (5,2). It appears that the output shifts the block of 4s outward, creating interesting patterns. Let\u2019s delve deeper into identifying that 3x3 block!**Analyzing shape transformations**\n\nI'm looking at how shapes in the grid are transformed. In this case, a trapezoidal shape in the input moves and changes. The output suggests that the colored area has shifted to fill available space, particularly at the bottom-right corner. It seems like they\u2019ve kept parts of the shape while removing others, focusing on retaining sections that touch the boundary. For instance, examining the bounding boxes helps clarify how specific parts of the shape are adjusted. I'm curious how these transformation rules apply across different samples!**Examining shape translation rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how shapes are translated in a grid. It seems a shape marked by a specific color is shifted to align with another marker, which is identified by its color. The translation vector is determined by the difference in positions between an internal marker and an external one. The process involves clearing original cells and painting the shape in its new position. I\u2019m trying to sort through how different samples align with this translation logic and whether all the markers are correctly identified. It's quite complex!",
