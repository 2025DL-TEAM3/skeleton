    "reasoning": "**Identifying digit mapping patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a puzzle where the input is a vertical grid of digits, and each row yields a two-digit output from an eight-digit string. The examples show that patterns map each row distinctly. For instance, from three datasets, it becomes clear that some digits repeat and perhaps count frequency or shared substrings determines the output. I need to find a consistent pattern to apply to the test input. What specific rule will help derive those two-digit codes?**Analyzing digit frequency patterns**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the first training set with the input \u201c44297288.\u201d I see that for each input, the output appears to be determined by the most frequent pair of identical digits. For instance, in \u201c44297288,\u201d the pair \u201c44\u201d is present first. However, for \u201c77299278,\u201d while both \u201c77\u201d and \u201c99\u201d exist, the output is \u201c99,\u201d suggesting they prioritize the highest numeric value. It seems the rule involves counting runs of exactly two identical digits, especially focusing on the earliest occurrence. I'll refine my understanding of these patterns!**Exploring digit rules across datasets**\n\nIt's tricky because these training sets might represent separate puzzles, yet they should share an underlying rule. So, I'm listing out the training rows and outputs to analyze patterns. For instance, with \u201c19411451,\u201d the output is \u201c59.\u201d I notice that might come from the least frequent digits, sorted in ascending order.\n\nBut as I dig deeper, I see inconsistencies, like with \u201c99411411.\u201d Here, the expected output doesn't follow the same pattern. I need to refine my hypothesis: should I focus on counting adjacent pairs or the frequency of digits appearing across the string? There's definitely more to unpack here!",
