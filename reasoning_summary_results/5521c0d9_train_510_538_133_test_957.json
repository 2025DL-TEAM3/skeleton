    "reasoning": "**Analyzing block shifts**\n\nI'm thinking about how the shift amount correlates to the block's dimensions. For instance, a block width of 2 means it shifts two columns to the right, while a block height of 1 results in a downward shift of one row. In the first example, if the block height is 6, it shifts down 6 rows. However, since the grid only has seven rows, the valid shift occupies just row 6. So, ultimately, it seems only row 6 is used.**Examining block placement**\n\nIt looks like only row 6 is visible when the block shifts downwards, even though it has a height of 6. The original area (rows 0-5) gets cleared to background. I\u2019m trying to understand how bounding boxes work for non-background cells by determining their width and height, then shifting them. The rules might suggest shifting based on which bounding box dimension is larger. In example 1, they moved vertically, even though the width was greater. It seems like an important decision-making point!**Translating row updates**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the updates for each row based on the input patterns. For row 2, all positions from columns 0 to 5 become '8', and columns 6 and 7 show '0' and '8' respectively, resulting in \"88888808\". The same process applies to rows 3 and 4, maintaining \"88888808\". Row 5 remains \"88888888\". In row 6, I change the original '9's in columns 6 and 7 to '8' and introduce '9's in columns 4 and 5, yielding \"88889988\". Lastly, the final grid checks out with 9 rows and 8 characters each.",
