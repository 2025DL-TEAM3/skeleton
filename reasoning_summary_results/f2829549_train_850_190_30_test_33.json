    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformations**\n\nIt seems I've discovered that when I output something like '00' '00' '03', it results in three rows, each with a length of two. This transformation definitely alters the height and width. It's all about summarizing counts or transitions along the rows or columns. Now, I should take a moment to look deeper into example 1, as there's likely more to uncover there about how these transformations work!**Examining pixel shapes**\n\nI noticed that columns 0 and 1 aren't zero but could form a shape of '9.' At row 6, there's a '9' present, but it's much lower than expected. Alternatively, output row 0 might represent a '9' shape based on various positions. I'm checking several rows to see where '8' appears since 3383333333 only shows '8' at column 2. The next row, 8833883333, has '8' at columns 0, 1, 4, and 5, not matching either. I need to analyze overlap and distinct counts for non-background pixels per column as well!**Analyzing column counts**\n\nI'm breaking down the pixel values for each column in the grid. Let's see which rows contribute counts for non-background values. For example, in column 0, only three values are non-8. Column 4 has four non-8 values, while others vary. I also noticed the counts seem to categorize the output into rows based on distinct counts of non-background values. It\u2019s starting to feel complex, especially when considering the rows that may group based on shape. I might need to rethink that grouping strategy!",
