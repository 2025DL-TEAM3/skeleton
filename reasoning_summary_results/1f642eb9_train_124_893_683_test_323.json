    "reasoning": "**Re-evaluating zero positions**\n\nI\u2019m examining a few rows for zeros at specific columns. Row 2 has zeros in columns 2 and 3, and that pattern continues in rows 3 and 4. For row 5, there are zeros as well. It seems this creates a block that is 4 rows tall and 2 columns wide. I need to check what happens to these zero positions in the output and see if they\u2019ve been replaced by neighboring values or maintained. The surrounding boundary values also play a role in these changes.**Analyzing zero replacement strategy**\n\nI\u2019m considering replacing each zero with the value of the nearest non-zero neighbor. For instance, at (row 3, col 2), the left neighbor is 3, but the output gives a 6. I am wondering if I should look diagonally or consider distances to edges. There\u2019s a possibility of value propagation from neighboring regions, with 6 and 8 surrounding the zero areas. In row 3, position 2 gets 6 and 8, while row 4 fills with 6. However, in row 5, the expected values aren't being updated as anticipated.**Examining seed replacement logic**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the distances of seed placements in specific columns. The top seed affects row 2 at the closest column, which aligns with expectations. However, the bottom seed in row 5 replaces a cell in row 3 at a different column than I'd expect. I\u2019m trying to understand why, considering that it seems to prefer the rightmost cell among options rather than the nearest. The logic in examples shows a rectangular block detection with alignment for filling, yet there\u2019s a contradiction in how cells are being filled per row based on their relative positions.**Analyzing seed interaction rules**\n\nI\u2019m considering how seeds might interact, particularly whether they influence nearby cells diagonally or based on midpoints of block sides. In example 1, I\u2019m noting how adjacent seed colors fill the sides of a zero block by checking neighboring colors. It seems that seeds only fill rows if both left and right neighbors are non-background colors. I\u2019m also pondering whether to take into account neighbors further away or if immediate adjacency is more appropriate. The seed logic needs to be clear throughout examples to maintain consistency.**Constructing output grid**\n\nI need to update only row 3 at column 4, where the original was '4411148.' The new value at that position changes the number from 1 to 8, leading to '4411848.' For row 4, I see that changing the digit at column 4 to 6 gives me '4411646.' \n\nRow 5 remains unchanged as '4411144,' and row 6 is '4444444.' Finally, row 7 is '4444344,' while row 2 stays as '4411144.' I have to ensure my output matches the formatting of the input, with no extra spaces.",
