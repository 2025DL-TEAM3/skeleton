In the first example, a 5x5 input expands to a 10x10 output by tiling the input across a 2x2 grid. The second input is 2x2, producing a 4x4 output, and similarly, it seems the pattern is applying that tiling concept where the output combines input and then mirrors some elements. I need to confirm these tiling and mirroring details carefully.**Breaking down tiling patterns**\n\nI'm exploring a pattern for transforming input grids into output grids based on mirroring and tiling. For example, for a given input, I see how to manipulate the input into quadrants: keeping the original in one, flipping it horizontally in another, and vertically in a third. I need to determine if this pattern holds up when checking against a 5x5 input. I found some discrepancies in the outputs, so I have to study them more closely. Let\u2019s keep analyzing!**Clarifying quadrant rotations**\n\nI\u2019m examining how to transform a grid into quadrants based on rotations and zero positions. Each quadrant has a unique configuration, like the original in Q00 and mirrors in others. I need to confirm that the zeros in each quadrant match the expected positions based on rotations\u2014I've realized there were some miscounts. By reviewing the relative coordinates, I see that the rotations are correct. I'll verify this process against a 2x2 example and ensure the rules I've found hold. Let's keep checking!",
