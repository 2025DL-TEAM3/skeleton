    "reasoning": "**Evaluating patterns in shapes**\n\nI'm considering a pattern that possibly consists of two filled shapes inside, one representing zeros and the other representing twos. For example, a 2x2 output might show two rows: \"28\" and \"22,\" indicating colors. There's an interesting 10x10 symmetric input that outputs three rows with six columns, like \"939339.\" In another 6x6 example, the output narrows down to just \"515.\" I think the underlying rule might involve removing a one-pixel thick border of the most frequent color to reveal an inner pattern.**Analyzing patterns and zeros**\n\nI'm examining a grid where the top and bottom rows are symmetrical, but the left column shows a non-uniform distribution. The output is \"515,\" likely coming from the interior region devoid of background zeros. By looking for regions without zeros, I find that the zero shape is defined between specific coordinates in the grid, forming a block from rows 1 to 2 and columns 5 to 6. Zeros appear in the upper right quadrant, but the overall zero distribution isn't symmetric. There's an interesting relationship between these zeros and the output shape.**Clarifying output order and zeros**\n\nI'm realizing we should follow the bounding box order from the smallest to largest row index. In the examples, I need to consider how zeros influence the output. For instance, if zeros appear in rows 2 and 3, they mirror to produce rows of zeros in the output. It seems the zeros region acts as a background, and the shape is the area outside of this. However, the expected output should include non-zero regions or some meaningful values, not just zeros. I wonder if we should focus on the non-zero regions instead, since zeros typically indicate background.",
