In the first two examples, no matter the varied numbers, the output consistently shows all 8s. In the third example, the input grid is more complex, but the output is again uniform, filled with 9s. It seems the rule is to identify the most frequent digit from the input and fill the entire output grid with that digit. This makes for a clear and simple solution!**Counting digit frequencies**\n\nI'm working on counting the digit frequencies from the input grids. In the first example, I've listed each row and counted occurrences of each digit, finding that 8 appears the most at eight times. In the second example, it seems the number 8 dominates as well, with two zeros present. Then, I\u2019ll check the third example with 9s, since I'm unsure whether it's mainly 9s, 8s, or 5s in that grid. Let's keep counting!**Analyzing digit frequencies**\n\nI'm reviewing the frequency of digits in various rows to determine the most common one. In the first example, I've counted 9s and found 24 total occurrences, while 8s tally only 12. So clearly, 9 is most common, which means the output should fill the grid with 9s. \n\nIn a subsequent test with new input, I need to count each digit's frequency across four rows. After computing carefully, I find that 7 appears 6 times, making it the most frequent. Thus, I'll fill the output with 7s across the grid.",
