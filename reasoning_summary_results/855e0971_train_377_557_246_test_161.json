There's a central rectangle formed by 6s, and the output looks like it separates these three regions. It might help to think of training in terms of aligning 3x3 blocks of the central object into a square or diagonal. Focusing on example1, there are distinct blocks represented in rows: the top has mostly fives and sixes, the middle has zeros with one six, and the bottom contains horizontal stripes with sevens and sixes. In the output, the rows match the input's region widths.**Identifying color regions**\n\nI'm looking at the input shape and analyzing the top region, which has a height of 2 and a width of 9. It seems there's a cluster of color 5. I\u2019m trying to find its bounding box, which appears in rows 1-2 and columns 1-6, with some color 6\u2019s interrupting. \n\nBut it gets tricky with disconnected 5s in row 2. I then consider example2, where they group three color patterns with fixed columns and adjust rows based on the first-digit value. The number of blocks should reflect the count of that digit in the first column. This might help differentiate outputs better!**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI'm examining how the output rows are generated based on the input. In the top region, rows 1 and 2 are identical, suggesting they averaged some values to create a prototype. For example, they derived a row pattern with the essence of the dominant color 5 and the neutralizing color 6.\n\nIn the lower regions, they did something similar, identifying and replicating color patterns while filling gaps based on their prototypes. The algorithm seems to partition rows into horizontal stripes, focusing on where non-dominant colors appear. This keeps the essence of the original input while organizing the output!**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing the stripes in the grid to check for consistent element colors. Stripe1 has a background of 7 and an element of 6. Stripe2 has a background of 5 with no elements, while Stripe3 has a background of 9 but also includes the element color 6. It seems like every stripe with an element different from the background has color 6.\n\nFocusing on the operations, I fill the stripe regions with the background color except at specified positions where the element color is filled. I've recalculated and confirmed that output rows match the final structure, resulting in:\n\n77559966  \n77559933  \n66556633  \n\nSo, I\u2019m ready to finalize that.",
