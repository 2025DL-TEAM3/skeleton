The connected components of 1s represent a single component in the first column, matching the expected count of 1. In Block 1, I can see that there are separate components consisting of the color 2: positions at (0,1), (1,2), and (0,3) are isolated. That brings the total count to 3 separate components of 2.**Counting color clusters and transitions**\n\nI'm reevaluating the outputs, starting with the idea that output[0][1] equals 2 \u2014 could that refer to counting the number of 2s? I see now there are actually 3, not 2. Exploring other options, I might be counting clusters of the minority color in block 1, where 2 appears 3 times. However, the output indicates 2, leading me to consider counting the majority color 8 instead. The connection among the 8s is important, and I suspect they're all in one cluster despite the separating 2s. I'll think about counting occurrences of colors or transitions, but it feels more like I might need to find a numerical relationship among them.**Scanning blocks for distinct colors**\n\nIn Block 2, I'm examining rows 6-9. For Row 6, I see '4' as the first distinct color, leading to the list [4]. Skipping duplicates and background values, I record '0' and finally '9', giving me a width of 3. The output for this row becomes '409'. So, when I tally both blocks, the final outputs are '869' for Block 1 and '409' for Block 2. Therefore, the final lines to output are 869 and 409.",
