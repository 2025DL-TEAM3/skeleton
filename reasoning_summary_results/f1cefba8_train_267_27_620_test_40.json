    "reasoning": "**Analyzing Shapes and Borders**\n\nI'm working through what seems to be a shape pattern, possibly a T shape or hourglass. It appears that specific positions marked by 3s in one row reflect their borders in another row. There's a clear rule: keep the outermost 3s, using the top anchor points to imprint on the border. It seems like only the borders are kept in the output, while interior positions are replaced by 1s. Notably, some columns get removed while others remain intact.**Defining Diamond Shape**\n\nI'm figuring out a shape, noticing that the 5s form a diamond pattern based on specific columns. The output seems to focus on selective borders rather than interior shapes. Each row has a positioning logic: I see how the 5s get placed at distinct points, like the topmost and bottommost pixels reflecting a diamond. It looks like the output keeps only the relevant 5s at the borders, removing anything interior to maintain the shape's accent in specific directions, alongside noting coordinates for clarity.**Examining Shape Projections**\n\nI'm analyzing a shape's bounding box and how it's projected. The topmost zeros appear in certain columns, leading me to rethink how I define the shape as something like a plus or cross. An efficient method might be to find the enclosing rectangle, shrink it symmetrically, and project corners to borders. It seems they only project corners vertically, which is a bit puzzling \u2014 why not horizontally too? The rules are starting to emerge, particularly concerning which parts of the shape get projected based on its dimensions.",
