    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle**\n\nI\u2019m looking at this ARC puzzle, which involves transforming 3-digit numbers into a block format. The first example shows inputs of '333' and '336' with an output of four lines. It seems like each input number is repeated multiple times to form longer strings. For instance, the lines in the output are composed of the input numbers repeated three times initially, and then ending with '000' for the last two rows. Let's keep analyzing the pattern!**Exploring grid patterns**\n\nIn this puzzle, it looks like they created combinations by selecting 2 rows and arranging them in a grid. For example, with inputs of three rows: '111', '151', and '117', they generated an output of 9 lines, each containing 9 characters. They probably arranged these inputs in a 3x3 grid format, with certain positions zeroed out.\n\nEach line in the output corresponds to patterns based on the inputs, producing three macro rows from the three inputs. There seems to be a systematic approach to tile the inputs, creating a macro-grid that reflects the number of input rows. In the first example, even though it had 2 rows, it still produced 4 output rows, indicating a specific tiling pattern.**Examining puzzle grid structure**\n\nIn the examples, I seem to see a pattern in how input rows translate into output. For instance, example 1 has 2 input rows but produces 4 output rows, suggesting a relationship where macro-rows equal the number of input rows. Yet, it also has 3 macro columns, which is tricky since 2 input rows show 9 total columns. It might be that macro-columns are consistently 3 across examples, while macro-rows relate to the square of the number of inputs. \n\nIn example 2, this creates a 3x3 structure of blocks, each consisting of 3x3 arrays, maintaining the input's arrangement vertically. The zero patterns in blocks may depend on their coordinates. I\u2019ll keep tracking these observations to unravel the consistent logic!",
