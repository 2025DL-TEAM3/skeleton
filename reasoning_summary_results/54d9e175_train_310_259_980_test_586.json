    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit transformation**\n\nI'm looking at a puzzle about transforming digits, focusing on the systematic mapping. In the first example, the input includes numbers like 35 and the outputs suggest some digits map to others. For instance, 3 and 5 both seem to become 8 in the output. However, there's a conflict when 5 appears to map differently in other rows. It seems the mapping might depend on the position in the grid, possibly splitting it based on rows of zeros. I'm thinking through the implications of this context!**Understanding mapping rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how digits are mapped based on their positions within different blocks separated by rows of zeros. For example, in the first input with rows 1-2 giving outputs of 8 for 3 and 5, while rows 4-5 give 6 for 5 and 1. It seems like zeros indicate boundaries that impact how non-zero digits are transformed.\n\nLooking at the second example, the mapping of 5 appears inconsistent within the same block, suggesting that position matters. I need to rethink how these mappings work, especially if they're based on surrounding context!**Decoding color mapping rules**\n\nI\u2019m examining how colors are assigned to blocks based on their non-zero shapes. For example, blocks seem to use pairs like (8,7) and (6,9) in a cyclic manner, determined by their involved digits. When analyzing the first example with a zero row, only one color is used for both shapes above the zero row, which is curious since previous rules dictated different colors for different shapes. Maybe shapes that appear identical receive the same color? I need to consider how similar layouts impact the mapping!**Calculating color mapping for blocks**\n\nI\u2019m working on a test that involves mapping colors based on the sum of values within defined blocks. Here, I identify shapes based on separators created by rows and columns of zeros. For each block, I calculate the total sum and use that to determine a color using the sum mod 10. \n\nOnce I assign colors based on these sums for each block, I create an output grid. Non-zero entries are replaced with the corresponding colors while zeros remain intact. This results in a structured output that reflects the calculated colors accurately.",
