    "reasoning": "**Analyzing an ARC-like puzzle**\n\nI\u2019m working on an ARC-like puzzle involving grids of digits. The input grid has 9 rows and 7 columns. Observing the input, I notice most rows show a pattern with '8885888', but some rows, like row 4 and row 5, deviate. Specifically, the output for rows 1-3 should reflect a mapping from '8885888' to '9995888'. This seems to involve changing the leading digits based on frequency. I need to analyze this further for accuracy.**Evaluating output patterns**\n\nI'm examining the outputs for the rows, noting that the first three positions in some rows changed to '999', while the 4th position often remains the same, like in row 4. For row 6, it changed from '8885888' to '9995999', indicating positions 5 through 7 were altered. The outputs suggest two distinct blocks in the grid, with rows 1-4 showing a different pattern than rows 6-9, which all output the same result. I\u2019ll need to further analyze sample inputs.**Examining grid quadrants and patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a 9x7 grid where both column 4 and row 5 are filled with the digit '5', creating vertical and horizontal separators. This divides the grid into four quadrants, each with distinct number patterns. \n\nFor example, quadrants Q1 and Q3 have anomalies with '9', while Q2 remains uniform with '8'. I notice that the output for Q1 and Q3 will be filled with '9's in response to those anomalies, while Q2 and Q4 maintain their '8's. This pattern establishes a rule for handling colors in each quadrant based on the presence of anomalies.",
