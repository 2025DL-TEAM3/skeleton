Maybe there's a general rule for reflecting the last three to the first three if the row has three distinct pairs. It\u2019s a bit tricky! Perhaps the first example represents a special case related to reflecting along the diagonal. For grid1 with nine rows, I should think about mirroring across some symmetry. The backgrounds in each example play a significant role too.**Creating a mirrored grid pattern**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how to create a symmetrical output by mirroring non-background pixels across the vertical axis. For example, in grid1 with background color 7, I'll locate all the non-7 pixels, which are at specific positions. I'll test by reflecting these non-7 pixels to the opposite side of the grid. The shapes formed will be represented as colored squares. The final output should include these mirrored shapes, ensuring both sides are symmetrical while keeping the original non-7 pixels intact at their positions.",
