    "reasoning": "**Analyzing block shapes**\n\nI'm figuring out a grid structure, specifically looking at blocks based on some rows and columns. For instance, in rows 1-2, there's a 7-block, and in rows 3-4, I see a 5-block. The overall structure seems to involve pairs of smaller blocks, focusing on how these blocks overlap and fit together. There appear to be various shapes: a 7-block, a 5-block, and others. I\u2019m trying to make sense of the relationships between these shapes and their positions within the grid.**Evaluating block relationships**\n\nI'm analyzing how different blocks relate to each other across a grid. It looks like there's a 2-block that represents a large area of 2s, but it may not account for background. In examples, regions of interest seem to be solely between specific blocks based on their overlaps. If smaller blocks are adjacent, that's when special rules apply for their interactions. I\u2019ll also explore a 10x10 grid to pinpoint structural details for relevant blocks and sizes, particularly focusing on the 5-block and 3-block configurations.**Determining block regions**\n\nI'm evaluating the relationships between different blocks in a grid. For example, the primary block\u2014a larger 3-block\u2014interacts with smaller blocks, and I need to compute the regions of overlap. It looks like I\u2019m trying to identify both the vertical and horizontal ranges of these blocks to see which regions they encompass. I need to clarify the concept of \u201cbetween-exclusives\u201d and how to treat overlaps, understanding how regions are defined and potentially covered with specific values based on those overlaps.",
