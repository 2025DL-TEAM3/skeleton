    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input shapes**\n\nI'm considering the input shapes and how to represent them correctly. For row2, the left has one 8, and the right region has a count of 1, which feels odd, so maybe I should hide it. In contrast, row0 has a right region count of 2, which seems fine to show. Row1 has a count of 3, which is odd, but I'm outputting both anyway. I see two mirrored shapes; could I overlay the right onto the left by converting values?**Analyzing shape interactions**\n\nI'm trying to piece together how the left and right regions interact. Combined, the left and right shapes yield specific output conditions. Row2 seems special; maybe its right region acts like a background because of its inverted pattern? When examining more rows, I find row5 matches the expected output, but row2 doesn\u2019t. I wonder if symmetry plays a role; perhaps the right shape must have as many points as the left to project correctly. The key might be understanding how these shapes relate across the grid.**Identifying shape regions**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the grid for consistent regions and found that column index 2 has all 1's, indicating a dividing stripe. This separates the grid into two halves, with values on the left and right. I\u2019m testing intersections of shapes from these regions, particularly checking row outputs. Row4 has an interesting case where it outputs differently than expected, despite having symmetrical shapes. It makes me wonder if there are additional rules about marking rows based on shape connection or their positions within the grid. I should look into other examples to clarify this.**Reviewing output format**\n\nThe output shows rows of numbers, and I need to ensure the formatting is correct. Right now, it's showing values like '000', which is fine, but I must check for leading zeros to ensure it adheres to the expected format. The examples indicate I should have numeric digits like '020'. So I should present five lines in total: 000, 000, 000, 002, and 000. Keeping the format consistent will help in providing a clearer output!",
