Row 1 has the sequence 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, while Row 2 features 3, 1, 0, 0, 1, 3, and it\u2019s repeated in Rows 3 and 6, while Rows 4 and 5 mirror Row 1. This suggests symmetry, possibly with rotations or tiling. Considering the input is a small tile (M) of dimensions 2x3, it might be interesting to see how this tile and its variations fit into a larger 3x3 block.**Rotating and tiling matrix**\n\nI\u2019m considering rotating matrix M by 180 degrees, which results in M180. To do that, I reverse the rows and then reverse the elements within each row. Now, M180 gives us two rows: [6, 0, 0] and [3, 1, 0]. \n\nThen I notice that the output is structured in a 6x6 grid, likely from a 3x2 tiling of these 2x3 blocks. It all fits together nicely after examining the arrangement and matching the output. So, it\u2019s revealing patterns through this tiling!**Constructing output grid**\n\nI\u2019m working on generating an output grid with 9 rows and 2 columns. So for each row, I'm taking values from specific blocks:  \n\n- Row 0 from block (0,0) gives \"44\".  \n- Row 1 gives \"77\", and Row 2 gives \"99\".  \n- Moving to block 1, it again gives \"99\" for Row 3, \"77\" for Row 4, and \"44\" for Row 5.  \n- Block 2 completes the last rows: \"44\", \"77\", and \"99\".  \n\nHere\u2019s the final output:  \n\n```\n44\n77\n99\n99\n77\n44\n44\n77\n99\n```",
