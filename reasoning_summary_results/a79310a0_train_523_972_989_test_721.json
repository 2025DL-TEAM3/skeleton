    "reasoning": "**Mapping grid patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid transformation, where it looks like we're working with an 8x4 grid. It seems that in each tile, the 8 serves as the background while the 1s are in the foreground. The connected regions of 1s are replaced with 2s, expanding the borders in some way. But, there\u2019s something puzzling\u2014like why a row containing a horizontal line of 1s to 2s replaces the entire row with 8s. Let\u2019s dig deeper into that!**Visualizing shapes in the grid**\n\nIn analyzing row 5, I see it originally contains three 1s at columns 1, 2, and 3. After transformation, it changes to 8228, indicating a shift that removes the outer 1s for a centered shape. The input grid seems to describe a plus-like shape of 1s across multiple rows, particularly rows 4 to 8, where I can identify their bounding box from (4, 2) to (8, 3). This results in a transformed rectangle of 2s in rows 5 to 8 and columns 2 and 3.**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nIt looks like I\u2019m trying to understand the transformation of a shape within a grid. The bounding box starts as 5x3, and when I remove one row and column from the edge, I get a 4x2 shape. It seems they might be using morphological erosion to keep only the interior cells of the original shape. As I analyze the neighbors of 1s, I find only one remaining, so this must be more complicated. The output does reflect a centered rectangle of 2s, creating a symmetric shape from the original cluster of 1s.",
