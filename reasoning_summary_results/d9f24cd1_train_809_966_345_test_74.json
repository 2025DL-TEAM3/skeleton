    "reasoning": "**Clarifying output transformations**\n\nI'm trying to understand why the contiguous region of 8's doesn't change next to the 4's. In row 3, where there are no 4's or 2's, all original values are 8's, but they change to 2222888888 in the output. \n\nFor row 4, I see the input was 8848888882, and the output is 8842222222. Here, columns 3-10 are changing to 2, likely due to the influence of the 4 at column 3 and the 2 at column 10. Wait, so columns 4-10 should consistently reflect this adjustment.**Assessing row transformations**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the rules for transforming the rows based on the leftmost colored non-8 digit. I see that in the input rows, most are filled with 9's, with exceptions in rows like 4, 6, 8, and 10. \n\nFor row 1, the change from 9999999999 to 9989998999 involves altering columns 3 and 7 to 8's, which could relate to some pattern or shape in the grid rather than just row-based changes. It looks like changes might involve a global operation across the entire grid, possibly influenced by the 4 and 2 in the earlier training. I'll draw conclusions as I analyze the mutated cells more closely.**Exploring fill rules in training**\n\nI'm examining how the fill operation works based on the special digits. It seems that the patterns formed by 1's and 8's define areas to be filled with colors like 2 or 4, depending on the training. \n\nIn training 3, I see a 7 at (2,7) and a 4 at (3,8). The entire row 3 changes to 4's indicates they fill from the special 4's location. I\u2019m noticing that the filled area stretches between these points, even including extra zeros beyond the intended limits. I'll need to refine my understanding of these rules to fit the fill behavior more accurately.**Determining row transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to fill row 3 while keeping certain columns unchanged. The original row3 input \"088988\" should change to \"000988\" by filling specific columns. Based on the rules from training examples, there's a horizontal fill from B's position, but no vertical filling occurs since B doesn\u2019t have overlapping rows with A.\n\nI'll propose the final output grid, noting that the only zeros after processing come from the initial and newly filled positions. It looks like the final grid remains mostly the same, with row 3 transforming as described.",
