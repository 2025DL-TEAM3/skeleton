For instance, input `00734` becomes `22734` because digits at positions 0 and 1 are altered. Then, for input `82727`, the output shows a different pattern entirely, reflecting the repeating 2s from the previous rows. It seems a majority pattern emerges for each column, so I'm considering how to find the most common element for each column and fill the grid with that majority. This might help replace irregular rows effectively!**Identifying column patterns**\n\nI'm exploring input rows to find a majority pattern in the columns. In column 2, every row has a 7, making it the majority. Column 3 shows 2 as the majority with three occurrences, while column 4 is more complicated with ties. It looks like they choose the common row pattern, replacing different rows while preserving some uniqueness. For instance, with input `00734`, the output changes first digits to 2, keeping the remaining ones. I\u2019ll keep investigating these patterns!**Exploring grid transformation**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how colored digits move in this grid example. The input shows a clear structure where certain numbers like 6 form a cross pattern, guiding how elements shift. For instance, colored digits from the top rows are projected onto the rows below, mirroring their positions vertically across the cross. \n\nIt seems numbers to the left of the cross are disappearing, while those on the right move downward. The digits 3, 1, and 4 successfully land in their new positions, but the 8 and 1 from the input are missing in the output. So, the rule appears to be about how the positions relate to this cross!",
