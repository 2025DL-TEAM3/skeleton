    "reasoning": "**Inspecting ARC puzzle transformation**\n\nI\u2019m looking at some examples of an ARC puzzle where we need to figure out the transformation rules. The inputs and outputs are the same size, and it seems like some cells at the borders change. Let\u2019s take the first example: \n\nThe first row changes the first and last cells from 1s to 4 and 0 respectively. In the second row, those 8s remain the same at the ends. The third row shows that certain cells get modified too, like the 9 changing to 1. It seems like there\u2019s a focus on reducing the outer shape.**Analyzing transformation patterns**\n\nIn this example, I\u2019m looking at Row 3 and Row 4, where the numbers in the output change significantly. The output mirrors certain positions, with a distinct pattern emerging. The rows both have a frame of 8s that outline a border of 1s. Inside that, various numbers are replaced with 1s in the output. The corners of this 1s border change to match specific interior values, emphasizing a pattern that's forming\u2014where the perimeter changes, but the essence of the inner arrangement alters as well.**Mapping interior corners**\n\nI'm analyzing the corners of the interior shape. At the interior corners, I have values: 9 at the top-left, 6 at the top-right, 0 at the bottom-left, and 4 at the bottom-right. This region is bounded by 8s from rows 1-4 and columns 1-7. It seems the output corners reflect these values, but they switch places diagonally. Specifically, I note a 180-degree rotation of these corners to the outer border: bottom-right becomes top-left, top-right becomes bottom-left, and so on. The ring of 8s stays intact while the interior is filled with the background color of 1s. So, the transformation rule involves taking corner values and properly positioning them on the border.",
