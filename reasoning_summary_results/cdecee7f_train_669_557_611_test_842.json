The input consists of non-8 values, which indicate anomalies and distinct columns. For the given three rows, I'll check which characters stand out. \n\nBy examining each row, I'll identify the anomaly positions and their counts. For instance, in the third row, characters like 6, 1, and 7 appear. Ultimately, my output should reflect these anomalies, represented in a compact 3x3 format. The output will be filled with non-anomalous values as per the rules.**Determining the bounding box**\n\nI'm figuring out how to choose the bounding box for anomalies. I've identified unique columns of anomalies, which are {1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10}, with an expected output width of 10. The rows show three anomalies, but my output must fit within a width of 3, which doesn't match up.\n\nI\u2019m considering ways to group the anomalies effectively, possibly by using a minimum bounding box or selecting specific anomalies to fill a compressed shape. It seems I need to focus on matching the output format while extracting the necessary anomalies.**Filling the output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing how to fill the output grid based on anomalies. The first row takes sums in a reversed manner, which leads me to think about filling each column. I wonder if I should use a serpentine pattern\u2014left to right on one row, then right to left on the next.\n\nI\u2019ll check each row for anomalies, documenting the sums. For the specific test case, I'm identifying unique anomalies, summing them, and finally filling the 3x3 output grid while padding with the background color where necessary. It seems like this method matches previous examples accurately.**Filling the output rows**\n\nI'm working on filling the output rows based on sums. For row 2, since I ran out of sums, I need to pad with the background value of 2. As I fill row 3 left to right, I realize I need to adjust how I access the sum indices for each row without skipping. \n\nThe final output grid is structured in a 3x3 format with each row carefully padded. Ultimately, this leads to the output being \"072,\" \"222,\" and \"222,\" and I confirm that the padding uses the correct background.",
