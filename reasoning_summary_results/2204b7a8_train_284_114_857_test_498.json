    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle where we need to find a transformation rule from input to output. The first example shows a grid of 7 rows and 5 columns, with some digit substitutions or overlays. The other examples provide further input-output pairs to learn from. \n\nI want to compare numbers and identify a consistent pattern across these examples. This rule will guide how we transform the initial grid into the desired output. Let's figure this out together!**Identifying transformation rules**\n\nI see that each row has 5 digits, with the second column showing an interesting pattern. The \"9s\" in some rows change to \"5,\" especially if surrounded by \"7s.\" The likely rule involves transforming certain digits based on neighboring patterns. For example, \"9\" becomes \"5\" if the majority is \"7\" in that column. Column counts reveal that rows with a \"9\" at column 2 change to \"5,\" while \"7s\" remain unchanged, indicating a local transformation rule may also apply. Let's keep analyzing!**Evaluating anomaly filling**\n\nI'm observing a pattern where zeros in the top half are replaced by \"6\" and those in the bottom half by \"8.\" The bottom rows are clearly identified, like row 6 being more than halfway down, hence the change. The rule I'm establishing is to replace zeros based on their vertical positioning, filling them with the nearest border color. \n\nIn this context, \"9s\" in certain rows might represent anomalies that also get filled with the nearest border value. I see that in both examples, anomalies get filled accordingly by their surrounding values, either horizontally or vertically. Let's keep analyzing!**Analyzing anomaly filling rules**\n\nI'm identifying that for anomalies in the grid, namely distances guide how we fill them with border colors. In the examples, I see anomalies like \"9s\" or \"1s\" that need filling. I'm concluding that anomalies will be filled with the nearest border color based on Manhattan distance. \n\nFor the current grid, the background is being established as the more frequent color, leading to the decision that \"7s\" will be filled based on proximity to the corresponding border values, either left or right. This method maintains consistency in how we replace these anomaly colors.**Building the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the replacement process row by row. Starting at Row 1, I find distances and decide on replacements based on proximity to borders. For example, Row 1 replaces its \"7\" at column 4 with \"1.\" Continuing through each row, I replace anomalies accordingly while keeping other background numbers the same. After verifying each row against the original inputs, I compile the final output grid as follows: \n\n```\n19919993 \n11999993 \n19119393 \n11913993 \n11999393 \n```\n\nThis represents the correctly processed grid!",
