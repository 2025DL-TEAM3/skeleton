Each input row seems to produce two identical output rows, and I'm verifying this with examples. For instance, with the inputs 555 and 585, I see that I need to duplicate each digit to form the output. It looks consistent across examples. Essentially, for every row of input, I\u2019ll generate an output string where digits are doubled, resulting in two identical rows per input.**Confirming output structure**\n\nI'm processing the input conversion where each number's digits are duplicated to form the output. For the inputs '81' and '98', I see that '81' becomes '8811' and '98' turns into '9988', resulting in two rows each. So, based on my calculations, the final output will look like this:  \n\n5588  \n5588  \n8811  \n8811  \n9988  \n9988  \n\nI\u2019ll double-check the ordering to make sure it maintains the same input sequence, ending with just six lines as shown.",
