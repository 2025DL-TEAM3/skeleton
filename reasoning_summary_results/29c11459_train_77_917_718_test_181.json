Observing a specific example, the first and last rows remain unchanged, while the middle rows transform. It seems like there's a rule focusing on clusters or connected regions of identical digits, leading to changes row by row. I'll note that the examples show a pattern of grouping, which might help simplify understanding the overall mapping. This involves some local observations about digit repetitions. It's interesting to consider how those patterns emerge!**Exploring mapping patterns**\n\nI'm examining a second example to deduce how input rows map to the output. The input pattern features a leading digit, followed by five 8s, and a last digit. I'm seeing that in the output, certain digits transform based on their neighbors. For instance, it seems like the 8s map to a combo of 4s, 5s, and 1s in a structured manner. I\u2019m curious about how these relationships and transformations occur, possibly averaging or overlapping with neighboring rows' outputs. There\u2019s definitely a sequence at play!**Analyzing interpolation rules**\n\nI'm delving into how to determine the mapping between uniform and non-uniform rows. In this example, I notice rows 2-4 are uniform while rows 1 and 5 are not. This suggests that the outputs for uniform rows are determined by their nearest non-uniform neighbors. \n\nRow 2 copies from row 1, and row 4 from row 5. For row 3, it appears to be an interpolated value between row 2 and row 4, effectively becoming a mid-point. I\u2019m considering a linear interpolation scheme where values from adjacent rows influence the output, depending on each row's position in relation to its neighbors. It\u2019s an interesting pattern!",
