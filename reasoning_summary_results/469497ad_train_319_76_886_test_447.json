    "reasoning": "**Analyzing glitch boundaries**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how boundary rows between distinct blocks create glitches. In Example 1, row 2 is 63444, making row 3 the boundary to the next block, 66666. In Example 2, the glitch is in the last row of 977, while Example 3 shows the glitch in the middle row 7333 between blocks 7331 and 7777. The rule seems to be that when scaling input by 2x, the glitch row transitions by mixing the colors from the blocks it borders instead of doubling fully.**Understanding color transitions in glitches**\n\nThe glitch appears to show a transition where colors mix at boundaries. For glitch input rows, I'm thinking about representing a diagonal transition. In Example 1, row 3 is 63333, with row 2 above it at 63444 and row 4 below at 66666. The scaling creates two duplicate output rows, with each one mixing colors from the rows above and below. For each column, it looks like I could blend colors from adjacent rows with bilinear interpolation, adding a new color for glitches, often averaging nearby values, but I see it's been consistently color 2 across examples.**Clarifying glitch orientation rules**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out the orientation for diagonal transitions in color stripes. It seems I should choose orientations based on whether the stripe row is odd or even and also whether the central value of the stripe below is greater than that of the stripe above. For example, if the stripe below's central value is greater, the diagonal orientation is negative, otherwise positive. The glitches seem to occur where the stripe row color matches the above or below at certain columns. It's a bit messy, but it looks like I need to focus on the first column where the values differ for identifying glitches.",
