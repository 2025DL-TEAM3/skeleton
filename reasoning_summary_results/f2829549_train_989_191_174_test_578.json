    "reasoning": "**Clarifying transformation logic**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the output transformation. I need to ignore the line of 6s and map values from the four columns to the left. For Row 4 and 5, the mapping works as expected. Row 6 and 7 produce the expected 3333, but Row 8 gets tricky. I see that the left half should translate 2222 to 3333, but the output is 2333 instead. Maybe I need to consider the right half of Row 8.**Analyzing row outputs**\n\nI'm diving into the output for Row 8, which is puzzling. It should yield 3333 based on the left half of input 222264222, but it outputs 2333 instead. Previously, left halves for other rows provided the correct output. I notice that each row may be assessing which half is more \"pure\" without anomalies. Row 8 includes a unique 4 on the right, so they likely switched to using that side. I wonder if the strategy is always to pick the half without extra colored elements.**Understanding row transformation rules**\n\nOn each row, either the left or right side of a barrier shows a hidden image, while the other side remains blank, filled with just 2's. The visible half informs how I reconstruct the hidden one. I realize that the mapping outputs only two values: typically 2 or 3. This represents a background tone (3) and feature tone (2). So, the non-2 values reveal where the hidden image lies, which I can then transform into the appropriate output for each row.**Verifying output grid**\n\nI've determined that in my analysis, 8 appears 5 times and 7 appears 4 times, suggesting that 8 is the background color. This leads to the final output grid of:\n\n338  \n888  \n383  \n\nNow I want to double-check if my selection of which half to extract is correct for each row. For Row 1, the extraction yields [8, 8, 7], which maps correctly to the output of 338. Row 2 confirms with 888, and Row 3 outputs 383 as well. Everything seems to align!",
