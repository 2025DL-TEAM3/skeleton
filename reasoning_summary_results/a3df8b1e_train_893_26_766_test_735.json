The input consists of a 7-row by 4-column grid ending with a '6' in the bottom-right corner. \n\nThe output retains the same size, creating a symmetrical pattern around the 6, forming a V-shape that includes both the main diagonal and anti-diagonal. It seems like from that single '6,' the value propagates upward and downward symmetrically. This is really interesting!**Examining the diagonal pattern**\n\nIn the grid, I see there's only a single '6' at the bottom-right corner, and it creates symmetrical diagonals. Starting from this '6', it spreads diagonally upward to form a V-shape. \n\nActually, this involves two segments: one going from (7,4) to (4,1) and the other from (4,1) to (1,4). The '6's are positioned accordingly, with coordinates reflecting this symmetry. I like how the pattern emerges from that initial point; it really highlights the diagonal relation!**Constructing a checkerboard pattern**\n\nFor this test, I'm creating a 3x6 grid. In Row 1, I determine that if (1+j) is even, I\u2019ll place a '6'; if odd, a '7'. This results in a pattern: 6, 7, 6, 7, 6, 7. \n\nMoving to Row 2, I notice that for even j, it\u2019s again alternating, producing 7, 6, 7, 6, 7, 6. Row 3 mirrors Row 1. Putting it all together, the final output is:\n\n676767  \n767676  \n676767  \n\nThis follows the original example's checkerboard pattern approach!",
