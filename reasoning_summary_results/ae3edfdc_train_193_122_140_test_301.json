    "reasoning": "**Transforming input to output**\n\nI'm noticing a pattern with the transformation from input to output data. The non-8 cells seem to have numbers like 7, 3, 1, and 2 in different positions, and they appear to be reversed or mirrored in the output. I see the specific locations of those non-8s in both inputs, which provide a clue. It's clearly a matter of rearranging these numbers, with most cells remaining as 8 in the final arrangement. Let's keep this approach focused and organized!**Analyzing movement patterns**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how numbers transform based on their positions. I see that for certain cells, it seems they move based on row and column relations, though there are inconsistencies. The idea of their movement might involve moving towards the grid's center or following a specific pattern. Observing examples, I notice colored digits form clusters, like a 'V' shape for 7s, which appear to shift into a triangular formation in the output. This clustering could lead to repositioning to enhance spatial organization.**Evaluating clusters around anchors**\n\nI'm thinking about how the numbers are arranged around fixed central anchors identified as 1 and 2 in the output. I noticed that smaller digits like 7s and 3s cluster around these anchors to create a symmetrical pattern. For example, 7s surround 1 at (3,3), forming a nearly complete hollow square shape. Similarly, around 2 at (6,5), 3s gather, though with some missing corners. The movement seems consistent with color grouping from the input, creating defined clusters near the centers.",
