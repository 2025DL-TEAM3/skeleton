In the example, each row's transformation from input to output reveals an intriguing pattern.\n\nRow 1 remains unaffected with all 5s. Row 2 loses its last column. Row 3 changes some values to 5s but retains one 5. Row 4 reveals a curious extraction of 4s, seemingly from a previous row. Row 5 transforms earlier 1s into 4s in the output, which is puzzling. I wonder if this reflects a histogram-like representation for counting values.**Exploring bounding boxes in grids**\n\nI\u2019m considering an alternate view on how these grids might overlay shapes. The rule seems to be about finding the bounding box of all non-5 cells and creating a new block from that. \n\nFor row analysis, rows containing non-5 values are 2, 3, and 5, establishing bounding rows. The bounding box spans from rows 2 to 5 and columns 1 to 6. The output maintains 5 rows, hinting at a row-cleansing process, which appears to reshape non-5 values while retaining overall structure. It's interesting how inputs transform uniquely!**Examining grid transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing non-5 positions across various rows. For instance, non-5 spikes in rows 4 to 6. As I check colors, I notice regions of color 2, color 4 isolated, and a cluster of color 7 creating an L shape.\n\nIn the output, it seems they removed the last column, transforming values. Some 4s are replaced or vanish completely, implying a shift in patterns. It appears that colored regions slide leftward, colliding, and certain colors remain while others change.\n\nThe rule seems to be about shrinking the width by 1 and regrouping, possibly cropping unnecessary columns. Color transformations are consistent across examples, with certain colors disappearing.**Analyzing shape transformations**\n\nI'm examining whether shape2 drops to the bottom row. Interestingly, it appears that shape2 stays at rows 1-3, suggesting only horizontal movement for color 2. The shapes may shift left to fill gaps, and some don't drop down consistently based on surrounding colors.\n\nI'm also noting that when one shape remains while another drops, it could be a rule based on the color's size. Colors larger than a medium shape might not be able to shift down if obstructed. I'm trying to simplify the rules at play to identify the output shapes correctly.",
