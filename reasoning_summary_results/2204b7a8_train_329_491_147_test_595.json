    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC Puzzle**\n\nI'm working on an ARC puzzle where I need to understand the transformation rules from the provided examples. \n\nIn the first example, the outer edges are unchanged while internal values seem to be modified. For instance, the first and last rows remain intact. In the second example, it appears all rows might be internal since changes are happening internally, particularly in column indices. I need to break down these examples more deeply to identify consistent patterns in transforming the inputs to outputs.**Examining transformation patterns**\n\nI'm diving into the input-output relationships from various rows to identify transformation patterns. It seems certain positions change based on neighboring values. For example, in row one, I note a shift in the 8th column. In row two, changes occur in indices 5, 7, and 8. As I continue, consistent alterations emerge across rows, suggesting a target shape influencing transformations. I need to confirm if specific internal cells with particular values transform based on surrounding shapes or patterns. This analysis is crucial!**Investigating transformation rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how the number 4 transforms into different values across various rows. It seems that leading 4's in certain rows change to 2's, while trailing 4's become 3's in others. For example, rows above the center seem to convert to 2's, while those below transition to 3's. I notice the first and last rows typically remain unchanged. It looks like a pattern based on the location of values is at play here. In contrast, the borders of other examples don\u2019t follow the same rules, indicating distinct transformation principles.**Examining digit transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing how numbers transform in a grid. For instance, in one example, alternating 4's and 7's get replaced based on their position. The 4's are grouped and replaced with 2's or 3's depending on whether their row is above or below the midpoint, while the 7's are replaced by 3's or 9's based on their column. This suggests a pattern where the rule depends on the position in the grid, and I'm noticing how shapes in the grid influence these transformations. It seems the orientation of connected shapes affects the replacement strategy across examples.**Determining color replacements**\n\nI'm figuring out how to replace input values in a grid based on their positions. For instance, if input values are 2, I need to check whether they\u2019re closer to the left or right border and then replace them with either 7 or 9 accordingly. The approach I\u2019m considering uses the midpoint to determine the division of columns, ensuring I replace values based on their respective halves. After checking these replacements, I\u2019m producing an output grid that reflects these changes accurately without confusion over equal distances to the midpoint.",
