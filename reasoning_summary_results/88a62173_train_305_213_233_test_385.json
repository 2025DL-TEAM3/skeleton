    "reasoning": "**Exploring symmetrical columns**\n\nI\u2019m pondering whether to focus on columns where the top and bottom blocks share the same values. I\u2019ll inspect each column closely, numbering them 1 to 7. For example, in column 1, rows 1-2 are [0,5] and rows 4-5 are also [0,5], suggesting symmetry. I could take those values for the output, but it seems a bit tricky. I want to ensure I'm clear about the output rows and their respective values.**Analyzing column matches**\n\nI\u2019m checking each column for matching row pairs. For columns like 1 through 5, they're consistent and match up nicely, so I'll keep them. However, columns 6 and 7 have mismatches and thus need to be excluded. I see that rows 1 and 4 have some matching elements, which is interesting. I\u2019m considering if row 3 could act as a separator between the top and bottom patterns, showing differences in the lower rows. It seems there are layered patterns across the data.**Finding the separator and quadrants**\n\nI\u2019m working on analyzing the grid input, which has 5 rows and 3 columns. I need to identify the separator row and column. Row 3 stands out as a separator since it contains all 4s. Checking column by column, I see column 2 is uniform with all 4s as well, making it the separator too. After removing those, I can divide the grid into quadrants, revealing three quadrants with [8;8] and one with [4;4]. Thus, I'll output the distinct quadrant values as:  \n\n4  \n4",
