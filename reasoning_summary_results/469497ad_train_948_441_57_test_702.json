    "reasoning": "**Figuring out filler colors**\n\nI'm analyzing how colors fill in specific blocks. It seems that the filler color is consistently 2, regardless of the adjacent block colors. For every pair of horizontally adjacent blocks with the same color, I can replace the boundary between them with a diagonal line of 2s, essentially creating an \"X\" shape within that area. The tilt of the \"X\" would depend on the row number, giving it a unique slant for each position! Let's plan further on this.**Identifying block modifications**\n\nI need to address how to insert a 2x2 \"X\" shape into the region where two identical blocks are adjacent. Each block is originally a 2x2 area, so together they form a 2x4 region. Only the second block in an adjacent pair seems to get modified by replacing it with the \"X\" pattern containing 2s. In row 3 of example 2, we found adjacent blocks, and I'll follow this rule for any two identical consecutive blocks in each row, modifying only the appropriate one. I need to clarify this further!**Analyzing block decoration rules**\n\nI'm trying to set rules for decorating blocks based on adjacent pairs in rows. For each row, I need to find the leftmost column where two consecutive values are the same, and decorate that block with a diagonal 2. However, examples show they only decorate the first pair found in cases with multiple pairs. There might be an offset tied to how rows are decorated, which could affect how many pairs I consider. I need to ensure consistency with the decoration patterns as I dive into the test inputs.",
