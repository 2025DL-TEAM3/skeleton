    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the pattern in rows**\n\nI'm looking at the rows of numbers and trying to understand the pattern. Starting with the first two rows, both have '7' in distinct positions. The first row has it in the sixth column, while the second has it in the fifth. \n\nIt seems like as I move down the rows, the '7' shifts leftwards, eventually appearing in the first column. This exploration of shifting positions could be the key to breaking down the rule governing these rows!**Exploring row and column patterns**\n\nI'm examining how the '7' is moving across the columns. The first two input rows have '7' at columns 6 and 5. As I progress down, I see that the subsequent rows shift the '7' from column 6 down to column 1. After that, the rows fill with '9's, reaching a total of 9 rows.\n\nIn another example, I noticed there are 10 output rows generated from an input of 6. Even though it initially seems odd, recognizing that the output shape can exceed the input based on the pattern used clarifies things. Interesting!**Understanding row and column transformations**\n\nI'm recognizing a pattern in how inputs present unique values while the outputs complete a full gradient. For instance, in one example, the '7' moves leftward across columns, filling all positions. Each output row features '7' from different starting points, essentially creating a series of rows with a '7' in columns ranging from 6 to 1. In another, the outputs feature all colors from a special column. Looking at the dimensions, it appears the outputs often exceed inputs based on unique values plus extra uniform rows to maintain grid size. I'll need to explore this more!**Evaluating the output grid structure**\n\nI'm visualizing how a square extends to occupy the full width, creating a vertical stripe of '8's in specific columns while filling the rest with '0's. This results in a new shape, consistent with previous examples where rows extend to match the specified width. For this output, I expect 9 rows with '8's in columns 3 and 4, while the others remain '0'. \n\nSo, the final output would be a block repeating the pattern of '008800000' for nine rows, and that feels right!",
