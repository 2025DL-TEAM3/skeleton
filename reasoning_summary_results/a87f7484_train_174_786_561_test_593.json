The first set of input lines consists of 10-digit numbers, and the outputs appear to be the last two digits of each input. For instance, 7191816131 gives 31, and 7799886611 gives 11. However, when I look at the second example, 3322771144 should output 44 instead of 33, which suggests there's a different rule at play for this one. I'm curious to figure this out!**Identifying output rules**\n\nI\u2019m looking at lines where ten-digit inputs produce two-digit outputs. For example, in the first set, it appears the output is based on the first two digits. \n\nThen, for the next input with a vertical arrangement of digits, I'm noticing the outputs come from rows 4 to 6, which contain zeros. It seems the rule involves selecting rows with digits that include only 0s and 8s. I\u2019ll need to clarify my understanding of this filtering process to ensure accuracy!",
