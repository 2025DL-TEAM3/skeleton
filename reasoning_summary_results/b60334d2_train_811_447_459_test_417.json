    "reasoning": "**Counting characters in strings**\n\nOkay, I\u2019m counting characters in the string \"777737737\". I want to ensure accuracy as I check each position. The substring breakdown shows a series of '7's and '3's, and generally, I\u2019m confirming I have 9 total. \n\nFor my examples, I also need to count rows and lengths, ensuring consistency. The second example surely has 10 rows each maintaining the length of 9. I'll group them for clarity and make sure everything lines up correctly!**Analyzing examples with shapes**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at Example 1, focusing on the center (3,6) where the input outlier is 6. The pattern seems to swap colors: plus is 1, diagonals show 6, and the center looks like it might be 1 as well. In Example 2, plus is 1 and center is 7. \n\nI notice that the center takes the background color in Example 2, but in Example 1, the center seems to share color with the arms. So, I\u2019m questioning why the color assignments differ between examples. It looks like Example 1 uses a vertical pattern for the arms, while Example 2 uses all directions, which is puzzling!**Verifying patterns in examples**\n\nI'm analyzing the patterns seen in Example 1, specifically around the center position (3,6) where the outlier is 6. I\u2019m realizing that I've mistakenly interpreted the center color. The output for row 3 shows a different pattern; so I need to check what the actual values are. \n\nIt appears the center at (3,6) might align with the background instead of an outlier. I\u2019m noting that vertical and horizontal arms are consistent in the plus shape formed, confirming that the diagonal areas indeed relate to the outliers. Overall, the representations align with a full plus shape, matching the consistency observed in other examples!**Analyzing outliers and patterns**\n\nI\u2019m examining how outliers and colors in multiple examples interact. For Example 2, the background is 7 with an outlier of 3, while in Example 3, 2 is the background and 9 the outlier. It seems patterns can overlap, but after checking, I'm concluding that overlapping patterns in Example 2 don't actually share cells.\n\nNow applying these rules to a test input grid, it appears that I have one outlier at (5,3). When applying the full plus pattern, I\u2019ll transform the neighbors and center accordingly, ensuring I capture all necessary positions. After checking all the rows, I\u2019ll finalize the output after making the appropriate adjustments!",
