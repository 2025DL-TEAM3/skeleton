I list out how each position aligns. \n\nFor Row 2, the transformation is simpler, as I can directly map the indices. Row 3 changes 6 to 8 in the output, a notable shift. Finally, for Row 4, I'm a bit confused about how some numbers permute, particularly concerning position 1. I realize I'll need to clarify how these transformations apply consistently across all rows.**Exploring Input Transformation**\n\nI'm trying to determine how the input grid, which is 4x7, transforms into the output grid of the same size. Initially, I wonder if it rotates or reflects the grid, but I soon realize it's not a direct transpose. For instance, the output\u2019s first column matches the last column of the input. \n\nIt seems like I'm identifying patterns where digits may swap positions based on specific values like 4, 6, and 8. In some examples, a rule emerges where certain positions flip, primarily around the center, and reversing the digits in the last example confirms this transformation pattern.",
