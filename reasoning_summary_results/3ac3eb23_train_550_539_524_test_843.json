    "reasoning": "**Analyzing checkerboard filling**\n\nI'm working through how to fill a checkerboard based on a seed. It seems they only fill from the seed's row and maybe skip default colors. I see that they replace '8's with '7's but leave some '8's intact. For example, in an input with many '1's, the positions dictate that '9's and '1's are present. The minority color is '9', while '1' is a majority. They create a checkerboard pattern, alternating rows vertically.**Understanding checkerboard patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing how the Manhattan distance impacts filling the checkerboard. Based on the seed at (1,2), I assign '9' if the distance is even and '1' if odd. It looks like I've got '1's in some rows, but with '9's introduced at alternating positions. In the outputs, there\u2019s a clear pattern: columns 1, 2, and 3 alternate between '1' and '9', while columns 4 and beyond stay as '1's. This creates a vertical stripe effect across the columns.**Examining pattern application**\n\nI'm analyzing how the pattern applies based on a seed position. It seems the rules dictate filling cells with a color depending on their coordinates relative to the seed, while some cells remain unchanged if they are already their input value. For example, the minority color is '9', and it appears mostly in columns 1-3, while other columns remain as '1\u2019s. I notice that even though '9's should propagate, they only seem to fill within a limited bounding box determined by their presence. Interestingly, there's a pattern where rows alternate between the original and a swapped version based on their neighboring colors.",
