I notice a diagonal pattern where input elements repeat as I slide diagonally throughout the larger grid, effectively wrapping the input array to fill the new dimensions. The output ultimately has 10 rows and 6 columns, incorporating the original values in a structured way.**Understanding grid dimensions**\n\nI'm figuring out the output dimensions based on the input. The input has 5 rows and 3 columns, leading to an output of 10 rows and 6 columns. This doubling is consistent across examples, like when the input is 5x5, the output also doubles to 10 rows. The pattern suggests that the output forms a \"sliding window\u201d of the input values, repeated diagonally across the new, larger grid. It seems like I'm creating a mosaic effect with overlapping input blocks, maintaining a clear scaling rule in my output structure.**Building the B matrix**\n\nI'm constructing an 8x8 matrix, starting with all values set to 4. For shifts (s) from 0 to 7, I place colored values only if they fit within the bounds defined by 2H and 2W. Each valid placement corresponds to adjustments based on the shift. As I go through the placements, I observe how these shifts create a diagonal pattern in the grid.\n\nIn the end, I\u2019ll check my work to ensure all rows are correctly filled and organized. The final output displays as eight rows, showcasing an interesting diagonal sequence!",
