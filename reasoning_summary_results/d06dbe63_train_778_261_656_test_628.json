Here's how they map out: In Row 1, positions include (1,1), (1,3), (1,4), (1,6), (1,7). Row 2 has (2,1), Row 3 features (3,1), (3,4), (3,5), (3,7), and Row 4 is (4,7). As I check each row, it seems these 9s create some shapes that connect the anomalies, but I\u2019m curious about the neighbors in Row 2.**Analyzing Anomalies and Patterns**\n\nIn row 2, only column 1 is non-5 due to the anomaly at (2,2), while at (4,3), column 7 is preserved on the far right. This is tricky! I\u2019m thinking the background color could be replaced based on the parity of the Manhattan distance from nearest anomalies. For testing, I can compute these distances and decide to preserve or replace colors based on whether the distance is even or odd. It looks like I'm uncovering some interesting patterns in these anomalies!**Segmenting the Grid Based on Anomalies**\n\nI\u2019m cutting the grid into horizontal and vertical segments based on the anomaly positions. The unique anomaly columns are 6 and 9, creating segments between non-anomaly columns. I notice that segments can also be split by the anomaly rows, with horizontal segments formed around the anomalies at row 2. When preserving or filling cells, I need to devise rules based on whether a cell shares its row or column with any anomalies. It\u2019s going to be tricky finding the right conditions for these segments!**Outputting the Grid**\n\nI\u2019m checking the output for the first three rows and columns. It looks like only column 1 is kept in row 1 while the others are replaced, which isn\u2019t what I expected. I\u2019ll default to filling all zeros with 5, except for fully preserved row 2 and cells around anomalies. Based on my pattern checks, I determine the output should be: \n\n055550  \n200002  \n055550  \n055550  \n055550  \n055550  \n055550  \n055550  \n000002  \n\nI\u2019m proposing this as the final answer, even though I\u2019m a bit uncertain about the fit.",
