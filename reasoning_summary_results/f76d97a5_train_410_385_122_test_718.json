    "reasoning": "**Mapping digits in examples**\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to map digits based on examples. In the first case, I see 5 mapped to 3 and 3 replaced by 0. It seems like a digit replacement pattern, consistently applied across rows.  For a second example, input 6 should yield output 0 while input 5 results in 6. In the last example, it looks like the smaller digit consistently gets mapped to 0. However, there's a contradiction in how the larger numbers seem to behave differently. I need to clarify this mapping rule further!**Analyzing digit mapping patterns**\n\nI'm noticing a pattern where the first unique digit in a row is mapped to 0. For example, in the first example, the 3 is encountered first, so it becomes 0, while 5 maps to 3. In the second example, 6 is the first digit, mapping to 0, and then 5 maps to 6. \n\nWhen analyzing further, it seems some rows map the smaller digit to 0 while others do the opposite. It might also be about the corner digit mapping. I want to confirm these rules to clarify the mapping process!**Counting and mapping digits**\n\nI\u2019m counting occurrences of the digit 5 in an input grid. In the first row, I find one 5, and similarly for other rows, resulting in a total of 6 fives across 10 rows. With 7 being the more frequent digit, I map 5 to 0 and 7 to 5. \n\nWhen I produce the new grid, I replace each 5 with 0 and every 7 with 5. The final output grid looks like this:\n\n55505  \n55555  \n50555  \n55555  \n55505  \n55055  \n55055  \n05555  \n55555  \n55555  \n\nI double-check that everything\u2019s accurate and ensure there are no extra spaces.",
