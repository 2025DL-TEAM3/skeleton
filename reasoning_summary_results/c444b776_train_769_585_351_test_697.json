    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation patterns**\n\nI'm unpacking a puzzle pattern based on three tasks that involve number grids. Each grid consists of strings of digits, which likely transforms according to some location-based rule or perhaps column scanning.\n\nFor the first example, I\u2019ll analyze the input grid, where the first four rows are all 999999. The corresponding output retains some of these same rows while introducing changes. I need to carefully compare the outputs with their respective inputs, focusing on how specific rows interact. There seems to be a recurring pattern, which is intriguing!**Clarifying the transformation logic**\n\nI\u2019ve figured out that the output rows are derived from specific input rows. It seems rows 1 to 4 in the output are just shifted versions of rows 6 to 9 in the input. Input row 5, which is 666666, remains unchanged in the output.\n\nThis suggests a transformation pattern where the significant bottom block is moved up and replaces the uniform top rows. In the second example, I notice row 5 stands out due to its different pattern. I'll continue analyzing these relationships.**Identifying input-output transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the transformation from input rows to output rows. In the first case, the output modifies the position of the digit 6 in row 1, indicating it\u2019s moved from the end to the third position. Also, there seems to be an extra 6 in the output, which didn't appear in earlier examples. \n\nLooking at rows 3 through 5, I notice consistent shifts and some digits, like 9 and 7, behave interestingly as they get repositioned. It feels like there\u2019s a reflective movement around the pivot row, which is distinct in nature. Overall, the pattern seems to involve repeating certain blocks based on their relationship to the pivot!**Analyzing transformation patterns**\n\nLet's look at the input and output structures in example 3. Here, the output rows reflect a symmetry around a pivot point. It seems that in output rows 5-7, they mirror output rows 1-3, indicating a balanced transformation. In example 2, I'm trying to identify the pivot row among others, as it appears to create an asymmetric pattern. It's fascinating that the unique elements in these examples shift down across rows, showcasing a potential systematic transformation. \n\nI should investigate if the last columns consistently affect the earlier columns to define a clear copying rule.",
