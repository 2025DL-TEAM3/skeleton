The second example shifts from 8 rows of 5 columns input to a 4x5 output. It looks like there's a pattern where two input rows are grouped to create one output row. I want to clarify that this is all about compressing the given data vertically and horizontally!**Exploring compression rules**\n\nIn example 1, the rows stay the same at 8, but the columns halve from 8 to 4. In example 2, the rows reduce from 8 to 4 while keeping the 5 columns unchanged. For example 3, I see 9 rows and 8 columns compressing to 9 rows and 4 columns. \n\nIt seems the rule involves halving the dimension if it\u2019s even and maintaining it if it\u2019s odd. I wonder if the task is about recognizing patterns in 2x2 blocks within the grid. So for even dimensions, I compress; for odd, I keep them as they are.**Determining grid output**\n\nFor Group 3, I see that the rows 5 and 6 suggest any non-zero values will yield a 1, leading to the output of three rows:  \n\n1010100   \n1111110  \n1111111  \n\nThis feels like a guess based on the presence of non-zero values, and I may need more clarity. Regarding the input, I\u2019m looking at rows and applying an OR mapping of non-zero to 1, which ends up with the output lines:  \n\n1010100  \n1111111  \n1111111  \n\nGiven the instructions, I'll stick to this output format since it's the best fit!",
