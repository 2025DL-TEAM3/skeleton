The input has 6 columns and multiple rows, and it seems the output consists of two-character strings per row. The examples confirm that each output picks the first two characters of each corresponding input row. \n\nFor instance, the input row \"111111\" results in \"11.\" It's a repeated pattern, which I\u2019ll apply when I see inputs like \"022022022\" that follow the same logic.**Extracting patterns for output**\n\nI'm figuring out the training patterns for this task. In my previous examples, the training used 2-digit repeating patterns across 6 columns. Now, it's changing to 3-digit repeats that form 9 columns. \n\nSo, I need to extract the first three digits from each row. For instance, row \"022022022\" produces \"022,\" and this applies consistently across the other rows. I'll make sure the output reflects this, giving me rows like 022, 005, 000, 204, and 052.",
