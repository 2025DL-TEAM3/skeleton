In the first two cases, I keep the rows the same while halving the columns. In the third example, I halve the rows instead. This consistency suggests I should detect whether columns exceed rows. If columns are greater, halving columns makes sense; if there are more rows, I could halve those instead. It's tricky to pinpoint the right rule!**Analyzing row and column outputs**\n\nIn example 3, I see that rows are halved while columns remain the same, which confuses me. It might be possible they're detecting unique patterns or collapsing certain types of rows. For example, the input shows patterns where rows can be grouped, potentially revealing frequency of digits. Maybe they are taking the most frequent digit from grouped blocks. If example 1 groups columns, each block might yield a summary for the output. Let's dig deeper into these examples to clarify!**Mapping and output assumptions**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the function g(a,b), where it outputs 2 if neither a nor b is the background. If either is the background, it outputs the background value instead. In the examples, it looks like I need to consider mapping based on segments that include pairs like (4,7) or (3,7). However, there aren\u2019t pairs containing both values simultaneously, leading me to output just 4s. Despite uncertainties in this mapping, I'll format the final output consistently and produce repeated rows of 44444.",
