    "reasoning": "**Clarifying row pattern rules**\n\nI'm outlining a rule for handling rows with a specific pattern. If a row starts with a repeating 6-cell pattern, it fills trailing cells with that pattern. For example, in the input, \"0000009999\" becomes \"9999999999\" because the last four are nines. Similarly, \"0000004444\" turns into \"4444444444\" as the last four are fours. Lastly, \"0000000404\" leads to \"0404040404,\" filling the row with repeated segments of length 2. This helps standardize the row outputs!**Analyzing row patterns**\n\nI'm working through how to transform rows based on patterns. For instance, rows of zeros remain unchanged, while for an 8x8 grid of sevens, then two distinct rows like \"73933094\" and \"79529094,\" the output consists of these two rows repeating for ten total rows. This means filler rows are replaced with the last two distinct patterns. I see that the overall rule is to identify and repeat the bottom rows to fill the top filler rows efficiently!**Understanding filler patterns**\n\nI'm breaking down how to fill rows based on adjacent non-filler areas. If a row has filler on one side and some non-filler, I fill it according to the pattern of the non-filler. For example, in a 10x8 grid, rows 1-8 are filled with 4s, while rows 9 and 10 introduce new patterns. I need to identify the largest contiguous filler block adjacent to the pattern and fill it accordingly, either vertically or horizontally based on its position. The largest block tends to dictate the filling direction, ensuring a consistent pattern throughout.**Finalizing output formatting**\n\nI'm analyzing how to fill rows based on identified patterns. In this case, rows 1-8 remain unchanged as filler rows, while rows 9 and 10 get filled with their patterns. So, for the output, rows 1-8 are identical: \"44444444.\" Row 9 becomes \"44066440,\" and Row 10 turns into \"22220222.\" I'm ensuring everything aligns, checking each column's values for accuracy. The filling seems correct, as I confirm that minimal repeating patterns were utilized. The final output is thus clear and structured.",
