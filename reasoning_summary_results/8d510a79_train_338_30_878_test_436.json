    "reasoning": "**Analyzing spread rules**\n\nI'm diving into how the rules for spreading values in different regions are working. It looks like 1\u2019s spreads only leftward in its region, whereas 2\u2019s can go rightward. But then there's a contradiction when a 2 in row 4 spreads right in a left region. For row 5, I see it's handling the spread of 2s in both directions. It seems that 2 generally spreads horizontally in both regions, though verifying this thoroughly is essential.**Examining spread mechanisms**\n\nI'm analyzing how the numbers spread in different regions. For row 4 with input 0000200401, it seems that 2 spreads towards the barrier, primarily to the right. In the left region, with the barrier on the right, this direction makes sense. However, 1 behaves differently; it appears to spread away from the barrier. The observations for row 1 and row 2 confirm that. The summary indicates that 1 spreads away while 2 spreads towards the barrier, which holds true across rows.**Defining barriers and propagation**\n\nI'm figuring out the barriers based on color coordination. In example 1, it seems the barrier color is always 4, while in example 2, it's 7. The barrier in example 2 is a horizontal line of 7s, separating the grid into top and bottom regions. Meanwhile, colors 1 and 2 spread differently, with 1 moving away and 2 towards the barrier. I realized that row 2 in example 2 isn't a barrier, since its changes confirm the barrier is indeed the 7s in row 3.**Establishing barriers and propagation rules**\n\nI'm determining how to propagate values of 1s and 2s based on the barriers in the grid. The barriers separate the grid into regions, allowing for propagation: 1 moves away from the barrier while 2 moves towards it. In example 3, I've identified the barrier as a vertical line of 8s in column 2. This allows for propagation across rows. I'll check the outputs against the rules for each region to confirm that the colors are filling in correctly and conforming to the proper behavior based on their constraints.**Finalizing propagation results**\n\nIt looks like my propagation checks are consistent, leading to the final output. I've confirmed the format is six rows of nine digits, so everything checks out.\n\nFor row 1, the original values stay intact despite some neighboring changes, while rows 2, 4, and 5 reflect where propagation occurred. This approach aligns with previous examples, where values filled gaps appropriately. Overall, the procedure is working as expected, and the final solution accurately reflects the completed propagation.",
