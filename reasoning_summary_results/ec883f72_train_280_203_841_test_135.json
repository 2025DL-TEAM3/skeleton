    "reasoning": "**Figuring out the pattern**\n\nI see there\u2019s a complex arrangement where the number \"8\" forms a rectangle and the \"2's\" create a smaller rectangle at row 4, columns 4-7. It seems the \"2's\" only appear at row 1 and row 7, but row 8 stays unchanged, which is puzzling. Why not row 8, since it mirrors row 7 with 7's all through? I wonder if that smaller rectangle's feature should be reflected to fit the top and bottom of the structure, which leaves me questioning the logic behind these choices.**Analyzing the grid structure**\n\nI'm trying to understand how the \"2's\" are centered within the larger \"8's\" rectangle. The eight rows show an outer border of \"7's,\" with row 8 being entirely made of \"7's.\" The \"2's\" form a distinct shape at row 4, columns 4-7, which is nestled between \"8's.\" \n\nIt\u2019s puzzling why they put \"2's\" only at row 1 and row 7, not row 8, since row 7 isn't part of the outer border. I'm curious about the reasoning behind their choices here.**Understanding the shape transformation**\n\nI'm trying to decipher how the output manages the numbers. For row 1, I see \"2's\" only at the ends, suggesting a pattern where they subtract from the length at certain points. Example 3 shows zeros at the start, with \"4's\" in a rectangle that seems to form a border from rows 4 to 10. Inside this, there\u2019s a smaller rectangle of \"8's\" at rows 6-10 and columns 4-5. It's like they propagate these shapes outward to form a larger structure, but it appears the outer layer is incomplete or asymmetrical. I wonder how systematically they replicate these shapes on boundaries.",
