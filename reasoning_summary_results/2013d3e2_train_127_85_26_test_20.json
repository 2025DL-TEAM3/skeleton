These create sub-blocks, and it seems like there's a pattern emerging\u2014maybe a rotated one. I need to pinpoint the bounding box for the non-2 cells. For rows, the minimum is 2 and the maximum is 9, so that creates a height of 8 rows. Columns with non-2 digits run from 1 to 8, forming an 8x8 block.**Analyzing bounding boxes**\n\nI'm looking at an 8x8 block spanning rows 2-9 and columns 1-8 with various digits, primarily 2s in the background. The output here is a 4x4 section from the top-left quadrant of that block, taking rows 1-4 and columns 1-4. \n\nI also have another example with a 10x10 block. There are 7s as the background and 6s forming a non-7 region. I find the bounding box for this region, which consists of rows 4-10 and columns 3-10, making it 7 rows by 8 columns. It's interesting how these segments might be treated differently in outputs.",
