Following that, columns 7 and 8 contain small shapes, but the output only has 6 columns. I think they might have removed everything labeled as 2, which could change the structure. So, I believe that now there are two regions: left (columns 0-5) and right (columns 7-8). By focusing on the left part, the final output emerges as a 6x6 grid.**Examining output mappings**\n\nI'm realizing that input row 0 is entirely zeros, and those zeros became 9s in the output, except for position 2, which remained zero. That gives output row 0 the values 9, 9, 0, 9, 9, 9. For row 1, zeros alternate with 9s to produce 909090. When looking at row 2, consisting of all 2s, the output seems to have a specific pattern as well. It looks like 9s correspond to where input color 4 appears in the subsequent rows. Let\u2019s align input rows 3 to 8 to see the mapping more clearly. Comparing these gives insights into how the values correspond between input and output. It's interesting how there's a change in mapping from 4 to 3 in later rows!**Identifying mapping regions**\n\nI\u2019m examining the input grid to determine the border row and the main region. Only row 2 is constant, qualifying it as the border, while the height above is 2 and below is 4. This hints the main region would be 4 rows high and 6 columns wide. The mapping region, which is a 2x2 block, is identified at rows 0-1, columns 7-8. For the main region, I'll check the shape color and background color to ensure accurate mapping. The main shape appears to be made of 3's against a background of 1's, and I will match those pixels accordingly.**Mapping input to output grid**\n\nI'm considering whether to map the background, as examples indicate it's often left unchanged. The main region is subdivided into vertical blocks for mapping. Each block's height is calculated from the main region's dimensions, and I determine the mapping relation. I compute each output cell based on whether it's shape color or background. After applying this logic to every row in the main region, I find the final output grid is indeed 4 rows by 6 columns, resulting in: \n\n911911  \n191111  \n010121  \n110221  \n\nThis aligns with the instruction to represent the output as in example pairs.",
