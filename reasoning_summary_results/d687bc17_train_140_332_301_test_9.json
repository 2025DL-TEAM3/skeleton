Since it's a digit grid, I want to think about it in terms of training sets, where columns are color-coded. This makes it easier to visualize the shapes against a background of 5 and 0. My next step will be to convert the first grid of Example 1 into a matrix of digits for clarity.**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI'm looking at the rows provided, and it seems like there are patterns being painted in the input. It appears that 5 might serve as a background fill, possibly blocking the space between 6 and 0. In the third row, the 1, 0, and 8 could represent obstacles within this pattern. I'm identifying vertical lines formed by the number 6, which is present in the leftmost column of rows 2 through 9. The corners and borders provide interesting visual elements to consider as I analyze the structure.**Recomputing grid outputs**\n\nI\u2019m recalculating the grid based on the given rows, initially setting up the output with the same values as the input. As I process each row, I'm identifying anomalies and removing them, adjusting specific elements accordingly. For instance, in row 2, I\u2019m noting changes and propagating values to ensure the borders are correctly filled. \n\nIn the end, I've constructed a final grid where most of the interior regions are filled with 9s, and I've confirmed that the corners and borders match the expected pattern.",
