For example, a 2x2 input results in a 4x4 output, so that\u2019s a factor of 2. Also, for a 3x2 input that leads to a 9x6 output, it looks like the scaling factor relates to the number of rows. It appears that the scaling factor equals the number of rows in the input, influencing both dimensions in the output. I'm wondering about the relationship of columns to rows as well.**Clarifying output dimensions**\n\nI\u2019m examining how the output dimensions are determined by the input matrix. For each input cell with value d, I create R x R blocks in the output, filling them accordingly based on the input rows and columns. Each output cell corresponds to a filled block. For example, a 3x3 input leads to a 9x9 output. I verified this process with specific inputs, ensuring consistency in replicating the initial matrix. It all seems to check out, so now I\u2019ll confirm with the second example.",
