    "reasoning": "**Analyzing coordinate patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking into zeros within a matrix and tracking their positions. It seems like there's an L-shaped formation created by vertical and horizontal stripes. For example, rows 1 to 5 show zeros in column 2, while rows 7 and 9 have all zeros across columns 1 to 6. It looks like there\u2019s a mix of patterns emerging, including the zeros alternating in row 1 across certain columns, which I find a bit confusing.**Exploring fractal patterns**\n\nIt looks like I'm visualizing some fractal patterns in a grid, specifically using nested L shapes at different orientations. I\u2019m creating a 9x6 grid to represent zeros and noting their locations. I see vertical stripes in certain columns and horizontal stripes in specific rows. For example, zeros appear in column 2 across rows 1-5, alongside other patterns. I\u2019m also analyzing various grid inputs and checking patterns that correspond to specific colors, particularly focusing on where these colors appear in the output.**Determining L shape patterns**\n\nI\u2019m working through how to draw an L shape based on specific coordinates in a grid. For each colored pixel at the corners, I need to find a pivot point that is offset two cells inward. For instance, if I start with the top-left corner at (1,1), I find the pivot at (3,3), and then draw vertical and horizontal lines to create the L shape. I then analyze how this applies to other corners, ensuring the rules for positioning remain consistent. Now, I\u2019ll verify if these rules work for new examples.**Verifying grid updates**\n\nI\u2019m checking the positions in the grid to ensure everything aligns correctly. I see row 6 should read \"09099292\" after recalculating, not \"00999292.\" I verified the entries in each row and confirmed they're accurate. Each row's transformation matches what I expected: row 1 ends up as \"99999898,\" down to row 6. I'm ensuring there's no interference with any L-shape arms during these updates. It looks good overall, so I\u2019ll finalize the output with the corrected grid format.",
    "test_output_text": "99989898\n00989899\n99999888\n00099222\n99099299\n09099292\n",
    "correct": false
