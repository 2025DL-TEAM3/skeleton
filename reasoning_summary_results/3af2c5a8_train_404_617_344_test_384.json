The idea is to fill the quadrants: the top-left with A and the top-right with a horizontal reflection of A. Let's analyze an example input of A = [[9, 9], [9, 4]]. The first row repeats, while the second row reflects horizontally. For the output, I\u2019m essentially using the original and reversed rows to create a mosaic effect.**Building the symmetric matrix**\n\nI'm constructing a big matrix B of size 2N x 2M from a smaller grid A. The top-left quadrant is simply A, while the top-right is a horizontal reflection of A. For the bottom-left, I'm creating a vertical mirror of A, and for the bottom-right, it's a combination of both mirrors\u2014a 180-degree rotation.\n\nAs I check the output rows against the input, everything seems to align: the mirrored and reflected values produce a symmetric design around the original grid. It looks promising!**Constructing the output grid**\n\nFor any given input grid, I\u2019m creating a tiling effect in a 4x4 output matrix. Using the test input of A with rows [2, 9] and [0, 2], I derive each row and its mirrored counterpart. The first row is constructed from A[0] followed by its reflection. The second row is based on A[1] and its mirrored row. After the calculations, the final output grid forms as follows:\n\n2992  \n0220  \n0220  \n2992  \n\nThis matches the expected results from previous examples, which is reassuring!",
