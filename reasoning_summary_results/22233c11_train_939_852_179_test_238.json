    "reasoning": "**Mapping input coordinates**\n\nI\u2019m trying to understand the new placement of the '8' at row 1, column 9. It seems there are two '9's: at (3,1) and (4,2), plus two '1's at (2,7) and (3,7). I\u2019ll list the input coordinates clearly.\n\nInput includes: Row 2, col 7 has a '1'; Row 3, col 1 has a '9'; Row 4, col 2 has a '9'; and Row 3, col 7 has a '1'. It looks like the output grid just reflects the values. So, I'll think about how to summarize these placements next.**Analyzing coordinate patterns**\n\nI need to examine the arrangements of the '8's across different examples. From the coordinates, it looks like they\u2019re placed in areas with background color, signaling new marks. It\u2019s interesting that the patterns seem symmetrical. \n\nFor instance, in Example 2, swapping and rotating coordinates looks like a potential strategy, but I find it tricky. Then there's mentioning possible anomalies in shape distribution, especially how to identify and extend them by 90 degrees. I guess I should explore this further to validate the structure of these placements.**Examining anomaly placement**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how the '8's are positioned relative to the anomalies. The patterns seem to zigzag, where, for example, moving up from (3,1) to (2,3) requires going up 1 and right 2. The '1's at (2,7) and (3,7) could indicate a vertical group, and placed '8's align with positions derived from anomalies. \n\nIt\u2019s tricky to track whether they reflect symmetry or connect the clusters. There might also be a pattern in how distances are determined from the background colors. I\u2019ll keep exploring this interconnectedness.**Finalizing output grid**\n\nIt seems like the output color is consistently '8' in the examples, so I'll place '8's in the predicted spots. I\u2019ll create the output grid with those placements. \n\nAfter checking the rows, Row 4 is now \"558555,\" which matches because only the second character (index 2) changed from '5' to '8'. Everything looks correct now with the final grid appearing consistent. \n\nSo, here it is:\n\n555555  \n555555  \n555555  \n555555  \n558555  \n555955  \n555595  \n555558  \n555555  \n\nThat seems correct!",
