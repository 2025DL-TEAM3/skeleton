I've observed the values in each impacted row, where row 5 yields a pattern, while rows 6 and 7 confirm similar sequences. Adding a border of 5 around it results in a 5x7 shape with the top and bottom rows clearly defined. It seems like I've organized this well!**Evaluating shape borders**\n\nI'm analyzing the structure of shapes and borders here. Initially, adding a border of 4 around a block of 5 results in a 7x9 shape, but it turns out there\u2019s only a single layer of each border included in the final result. Each row is designed with specific patterns, layering the borders correctly. \n\nIn a secondary example, the borders of 6 and 9 are also applied effectively, simplifying multiple layers into just one. So the trimmings reduce any excess while maintaining the central shapes. I'm piecing this together!**Clarifying layering process**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid with nested color layers. In this case, it seems we have several layers, but only some should remain. The goal is to keep just the main layers \u2014background, secondary, and shape border\u2014 while collapsing identical rows into one to reduce complexity. \n\nFor example, I'm identifying distinct regions by the colors, which helps understand the structure better. I'm tracking the bounding boxes of significant colors, focusing on cells containing the inner color that needs to be preserved. I need to ensure accuracy while simplifying the layers!**Finalizing layer processing**\n\nI'm analyzing grid layers to determine borders and colors. For instance, I've identified the inner layers and how they nest together based on their colors. I've figured out the bounding boxes and established layer indexing.\n\nUltimately, I need to create an output with a defined thickness for each layer. This involves determining distances to the borders for color assignment, ensuring the output matches expected patterns. I'm ensuring strengths are validated correctly by checking previous color layers and confirming the overall structure aligns with example outputs I've referenced.",
