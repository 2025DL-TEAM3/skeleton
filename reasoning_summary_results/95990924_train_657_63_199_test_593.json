The grid measurements are 9 rows by 8 columns, and I noticed that in certain rows, specifically rows 1 and 2, there are configurations creating potential 2x2 blocks of 0's. I need to focus on those areas to check how many distinct 2x2 blocks can be identified based on their positions.**Identifying block placements**\n\nI'm analyzing the grid to identify the 2x2 blocks formed by 0's. The first block is between rows 1 and 2, specifically in columns 5 and 6. The second block is found in rows 4 and 5, covering columns 1 and 2. \n\nFor Block A, I'll place numbers 1 and 2 above it at row 0, with 1 at column 4 and 2 at column 7. For Block B, I'll place 1 at column 0 and 2 at column 3 on row 3. I need to be cautious about overwriting existing values. After placing the numbers, I'll adjust the rows accordingly.**Finalizing the output grid**\n\nI'm setting up the output grid based on the identified blocks. For Block A, I\u2019ve assigned values around the 2x2 area. The top-left is at (row 0, col 4) with a value of 1, and the top-right is at (row 0, col 7) with a value of 2. The bottom row values correspondingly change for the bottom-left and bottom-right. \n\nSimilarly, for Block B, I assign values at positions for row 3 and row 6.
