In r3 to r5, I've got r3 at [6......2], and r4 has too many numbers: [7 8 6 3 8 8 4 8]. Maybe the extracted region rotates? The output is '63','27','04', possibly corresponding to a matrix like this:\n\n6 3\n2 7\n0 4\n\nI\u2019m checking coordinates: 6,3 in row4, col3 and col4 matches. The next number '27' is tricky\u2014I\u2019m pinpointing its exact column location now.**Analyzing pixel regions**\n\nI\u2019m examining the matrix, noting that '7' is at row4, col1, but then it seems swapped. The output shows '2' and '7' for the second row, suggesting some mapping might happen here. For the input matrix, I'm identifying non-background pixels.\n\nSpotting non-8 areas, I find clusters across rows and their corresponding columns, leading me to think about cropping a specific subgrid. This cropping might give me a 4x6 matrix, yet the output is a 3x2 format. It looks like I need to pinpoint specific columns accurately to confirm the origin of those digits.**Exploring connected pixel clusters**\n\nIn this example, I\u2019m examining multiple non-8 pixel positions for connectivity using a cluster approach. I find isolated positions and small clusters, noting sizes and connections. \n\nThe largest clusters I've identified are size 2, with adjacent pixels generating '63' and '62'. However, I'm puzzled about deriving the second row, '27'. It seems clusters are chosen based on horizontal connectivity. I notice that if I consider diagonal connections or group pixels by color code, there might be alternate pairings or interpretations. I need to untangle how they decide on clusters beyond the obvious pairings.",
