It seems there are sixes in row 1 at columns 5 and 7, and also in row 2 at columns 5, 6, and 7. This forms an L-shape, where row 1 has a gap at column 6. \n\nIt looks like to fill this nearly complete rectangle, I will replace the missing value with a 4. So for that area, I\u2019ll output the filled rectangle by replacing (1,6) with 4.**Examining clusters in example 2**\n\nIn example 2, I'm seeing clusters of digit 3s, particularly in rows 1 and 3 at columns 7 and 8. Despite their presence, they weren't filled. It seems that the predominant pattern involves color 1 dominating the background. \n\nI noticed that rows 1 to 3 almost form a 2x2 rectangle of 3s but with a gap at (2,7). Meanwhile, looking at the clusters of 9s in rows 4 to 6 also reveals that they have a nearly complete rectangle, though (5,3) remains unfilled. I'm trying to understand how these patterns interact with their respective filled digits.**Reevaluating hole filling logic**\n\nI'm analyzing how holes are filled in various examples. In example 1, the hole at (1,6) was filled, while in example 2, holes at (2,7) and (5,3) remained unfilled. It seems like holes touching the border are filled, while interior holes are not. \n\nIn example 3, the hole at (4,3) was not filled either. I\u2019m wondering if there's a specific pattern or rule behind when these holes are filled, especially with different clusters and their sizes. It seems that unique clusters might play a role in determining which holes are selected for filling.**Analyzing anomaly filling rules**\n\nI\u2019m exploring how different rules apply for filling anomalies based on their locations and counts. In the first example, there are no rows with exactly one anomaly, so the cluster of anomalies is filled instead. In examples where there are rows with one anomaly, they mark the leftmost cell instead. \n\nIn subsequent tests, it seems the filling rules depend on whether the anomalies touch a border or not. I need to clarify these rules further to predict outcomes based on the grid configurations accurately.",
