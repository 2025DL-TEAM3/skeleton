    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC Puzzle**\n\nI'm digging into an ARC puzzle with patterns shown in the examples. The first input has rows, and the output includes the original rows plus new ones, totaling ten. It looks like they rotate non-5 segments to generate additional rows. \n\nTo break it down further, each row's unique number segment shifts into a new position that reflects a sort of rotation. For example, the \u201c025\u201d from the first row moves based on its identified positions. Let's keep exploring how these mappings work!**Understanding the Puzzle Pattern**\n\nI'm breaking down the sliding block mechanism in this ARC puzzle. Each non-5 segment moves left across rows, transitioning their positions across columns. I see two distinct sequences, \u201c025\u201d and \u201c465,\u201d which slide into four positions in the columns: 7, 5, 3, and 1. \n\nFor the second example, the rows create similar shifts where the blocks of non-1 move left until they fall off the grid, filling empty spaces with all 1s. It's intriguing how the patterns overlap!**Mapping Connected Components**\n\nI'm exploring the movement of non-background pixels, treating them as distinct colors forming connected components (CCs). For instance, in example 2, there's a single non-background color, \u201c7,\u201d which forms a 2x3 block. In contrast, example 1 shows multiple non-background colors (0, 2, 4, 6). \n\nI notice that the connected components move down-left according to a defined vector until they go off-grid. Their patterns maintain their relationships, which means these sequences can combine into a coherent output. I find the dynamics of these movements particularly intriguing!**Verifying Output Grid**\n\nI'm counting the columns for the rows, looking at the configurations. The pattern mainly consists of 7s, with a few 6s. It's clear from my observations that rows 5 and 6 introduce variations in the second column, while rows 7 to 10 remain consistent with all 7s. \n\nI notice I need to double-check against the examples for consistent output. Each example retained 10 rows, including additional blank rows as needed. The final output grid looks correct. Here's the structured output! \n\n777776777  \n777767777  \n777677777  \n776777777  \n767777777  \n677777777  \n777777777  \n777777777  \n777777777  \n777777777",
