In the second row, I notice multiple values like 9 and 8, leading to confusion about which to change. It seems only unique numbers should be altered, especially those positioned as borders. This means I need to reassess their locations and how I define \"border.\" It's definitely a tricky puzzle to navigate!**Examining color isolation**\n\nI'm analyzing colors in the grid to determine if they're isolated or part of a group. For instance, color 9 at (2,2) and color 8 at (2,9) are isolated and will change to 1. However, I see that colors at (2,4) and (2,5) are grouped as they\u2019re adjacent, so they remain unchanged. \n\nIt seems there\u2019s confusion over color 6 at (5,1) as it's surrounded by different colors. I need to consider the counting and grouping rules more carefully to clarify which colors change.**Summarizing non-zero clusters**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid with 10 rows and 2 columns. I found three non-zero pixels at (2,2), (6,2), and (10,2). Each of these pixels is isolated, meaning they don't share any neighbors, so I'll change them to '1' while the zeros stay zeros. This leads to the output grid where rows 2, 6, and 10 will each be represented as \"01,\" while all other rows remain \"00.\" \n\nSo the final output will be:\n\n00  \n01  \n00  \n00  \n00  \n01  \n00  \n00  \n00  \n01",
