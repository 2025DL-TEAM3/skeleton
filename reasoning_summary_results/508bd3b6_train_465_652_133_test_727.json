    "reasoning": "**Analyzing diagonal patterns**\n\nI'm trying to understand how the output overlays the 3s on the row of 7s. It looks like a line starts after the 2s run ends. There's a diagonal of 2s marked from (3,2) to (5,0), and the output reflects this with a diagonal of 3s from (4,3) to (6,5). This seems like a reflection across a pivot with a shift, indicating a complementary diagonal within a square area. The 3x3 square where the 2s appear is mirrored above into the region of 3s.**Examining diagonal relationships**\n\nI'm looking at how they draw the opposite diagonal in the block from rows 4-6 and columns 3-5, where the diagonal of 3s ascends with positions like (4,3) to (6,5). This diagonal has a slope of +1, indicating that the column value increases as the row value increases. They seem to color the opposite diagonal using 3s, creating a new shape. \n\nIn example input 2, which is a 9x6 grid, I notice the presence of 1s forming a diagonal that reflects a slope of -1 from (0,5) to (2,3). The output changes some values, like row 3 turning a 5 into a 3. It looks like rows 3 to 5 have variations involving 3s.**Exploring diagonal reflections**\n\nI\u2019m checking if there\u2019s a 5 at (2,4), but it\u2019s actually a 6. It looks like the initial diagonal might consist of 6s; they appear at positions like (0,4) and (1,5). However, at (2,3) and (2,4), I see 6s, not forming an obvious diagonal.\n\nIn example 3, it seems they draw 3s that directly reflect the positions of the 5s. This pattern suggests a systematic approach across blocks, where they find the smallest square region of a color, then transpose that shape into a blank area. It\u2019s interesting how these shapes and reflections interact!",
