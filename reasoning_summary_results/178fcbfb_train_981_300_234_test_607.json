    "reasoning": "**Exploring transformation rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how certain rows like 7777 and 1777 relate to their outputs; for example, when there's a minority value, they generate a new row filled with that value. It seems if one number differs, the row produces that minority across all columns. In 7777\u2019s case, they replaced one 7 with 2, leading to outputs like 2777. I\u2019m wondering if there's a deeper rule based on counting occurrences or even column-wise patterns influencing this? It\u2019s fascinating to unravel these transformations!**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m examining a grid with 9 rows, focusing on how colors relate to values. The numbers correspond to colors, and I notice a trend: if a row is uniform, the output highlights the unique minority color in the first cell while keeping the rest the same. In the example, rows 3 and 7 are uniform, and the rare color, 2, is represented in the first cell, fitting the established pattern. I find this intriguing as it shows how inferring rules from color distribution can clarify outputs!**Clarifying row output rules**\n\nI\u2019m investigating how outputs are determined based on minor and major elements in rows. Each row has rules: if a minority exists, fill with that value; if uniform, replace the first cell with the globally least frequent element. In examining rows like row 1 with competing minorities (2 and 3), it seems they select the larger value when both are present. The output for row 3 being 622222 rather than all 6s hints at a special case handling for counting as unique, serving as a fascinating nuance in the rules at play!**Determining rules for row outputs**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the output rules for different training sets based on how minority values affect the results. For cases like training 1 and 2, it seems they treat unique elements differently, opting to retain majority values when a count is involved. In training 1, uniform rows led to a reduction in the major count, but training 3 left some values unchanged. My conclusion is if there's no unique value, rows should remain unchanged, while those with a single different value should adjust according to the rules. This approach helps me generate a final output grid that maintains logic!",
