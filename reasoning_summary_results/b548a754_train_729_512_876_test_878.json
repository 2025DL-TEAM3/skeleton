    "reasoning": "**Analyzing transformation puzzle**\n\nI'm analyzing this transformation puzzle where we have input and output grids of numbers. The first two rows are unchanged, and I notice similarities in rows three to six. Specifically, row five changes from 99994 to 95594, which mirrors a previous pattern in row four. Then, row six shifts to 99994, mirroring row three in the input. It seems there\u2019s a symmetry in rows three to six that dictates the changes. Understanding this pattern could help deduce the transformation rule better!**Deciphering row transformations**\n\nLet\u2019s look closely at rows three to six. In the input, rows three and four stay the same, and row five changes from 99994 to 95594, reflecting the symmetry at play. Row six, which is unique with 44344, has a different color, possibly indicating an anomaly. It seems that instead of this row, the upper rows might shift downward to create symmetry. I think the goal is to identify and replace the anomaly to maintain a balanced pattern. Observations support that they\u2019re expanding and replicating the upper pattern downwards.**Understanding row symmetry**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the transformation between the input and output rows in these examples. In the second example, rows four to six form a palindromic block, which then gets expanded to maintain symmetry. The output retains the unique row structures from the input, replicating the middle row throughout. In the third example, I notice unique rows marked with 8s and 5s, which guide how to fill the surrounding rows. The rule appears to be about identifying anomalies and using them to create a symmetric pattern around a central axis. The goal is to maintain harmony while reflecting rows based on unique anomalies.**Examining output mirroring**\n\nI'm reviewing how outputs for rows 2-6 are formed. Initially, I thought rows should reflect symmetrically around a central row. For the second example, I realize there's a unique row that gets repeated, while other rows are a mix from the input. The output doesn't follow a strict mirroring rule but appears to take an interesting middle row and replicate it. I notice that each example may have its distinct patterns\u2014understanding these differences is essential to grasp the entire mirroring process accurately.**Creating a symmetric block**\n\nI'm working on adjusting the rows to produce a palindromic structure. By shifting rows and creating a symmetrical block, I intend to set up a pattern: rows with 7776 and 7176, ensuring a nice mirrored effect. The output should clearly show this new symmetry: rows 3 to 6 reflect as A-B-B-A. However, it's all about keeping boundaries consistent while ensuring the expansion makes sense. This process helps achieve a logical final arrangement, ultimately benefiting the overall structure.",
