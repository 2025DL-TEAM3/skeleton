    "reasoning": "**Analyzing patterns in grids**\n\nI\u2019m looking at pairs like (3,6), (4,5), (5,4), and (6,3) that suggest a symmetric shape, possibly resembling a big X formed by two diagonals. The main diagonal has positions with values of 4 and 0, while the anti-diagonal has 6 and 7. This pattern creates a 4x4 block from rows 3 to 6 and columns 3 to 6. There are only eight distinct values that deviate from five, indicating an expanding pattern. Let\u2019s explore the output grid to confirm.**Examining diagonal values**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the values at specific positions, starting with (1,1) which has a value of 4, matching the main diagonal pattern. It seems like the pattern shifts upward. I've confirmed that values remain consistent at (5,5) and (6,6) as zero, while (7,7) is also zero. \n\nTo extend my understanding, I\u2019m checking the anti-diagonal positions, originally holding values of 6 and 7 at certain coordinates. I found all relevant entries, which creates an anti-diagonal that\u2019s reflected across the grid, exploring its symmetry within the block.**Exploring diagonal patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing the pattern to identify contiguous line segments of non-background cells. The seeds mainly form diagonal lines at slopes of +1, but no vertical or horizontal ones in the initial input. I found three seeds at positions (4,6), (5,7), (6,8) that confirm this positive diagonal slope.\n\nOn the other hand, examining the slope -1 diagonal, I noticed the anti-diagonal primarily defaults, with only one non-background cell in the center. It appears the pattern focuses on propagating the primary diagonal, potentially ignoring the anti-diagonal since relevant seeds are absent.",
