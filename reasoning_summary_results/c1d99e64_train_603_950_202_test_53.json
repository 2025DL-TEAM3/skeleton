    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC transformation**\n\nI\u2019m examining an ARC transformation using several training examples. The input grid consists of ten rows, each with nine characters, and the output retains the same shape. Looking closely, I see that the transformation replaces 6s with 2s, but not in every instance. For example, in the first row, only two of the three 6s are transformed. I need to figure out if this change is based on the position of the 6s rather than a blanket replacement. Let's keep digging deeper!**Examining position transformations**\n\nI\u2019m looking closely at some row transformations. For example, in the row \"333666633,\" I see that the first two 6s (positions 4 and 5) are changed to 2s, while the last two remain 6s. It seems like only contiguous runs of 6s are partially transformed, and I need to pinpoint how many get converted. Each row I'm checking shows similar patterns where the leftmost 6s get changed first, which raises questions about consistent rules. Let\u2019s clarify these transformations further!**Investigating column transformations**\n\nI'm considering how transformations impact specific columns in the grid. It looks like the 4s in the longest horizontal line are transformed, particularly focusing on columns where they appear most frequently. For example, in one case, column 4 has the most 6s, so all those are changed to 2s. However, full rows of the target color might receive special treatment, as seen in other examples. I need to confirm the patterns of these transformations across rows and columns. Let's clarify that logic further!",
