    "reasoning": "**Analyzing color patterns**\n\nI'm noticing a pattern with colored lines. If there's a line filled with a color adjacent to a zero-border line of the same color, the border seems to spread to all rows in that block. It looks like the rows change to match the border's color. However, in the bottom block example, row 7 stays the same, while row 8 remains pure color. It appears the border only propagates from the top into the block above.**Examining block transformations**\n\nLet\u2019s look at the 4-block: row 3 has 4444, and above it, row 2 has 0999, marking a different block. The first line of row 3 sees a border, but since row 2 is a different block, we focus on row 3 and row 4: 4444 and 0444. Row 4 has a left border, which sets the pattern for the block, changing row 3 to 0444 and rows 5 and 6 to match. \n\nNow, for the 7-block, row 7 has 0777, and row 8 remains pure. It appears as only adjacent pure rows to the border transform, yet row 8 stays unchanged. The border only influences pure rows above it. From other examples, they propagate this upward and downward for boundaries but only inside the block. It seems they consider both the minimum and maximum border occurrences for transformations.**Clarifying propagation rules**\n\nI'm trying to work through how the propagation of borders operates. It seems they primarily work in one direction. The goal is to standardize blocks with a zero border, given sequences of same-color blocks. Here's a thought: each contiguous block should have one reference row containing a 0, which then sets the pattern for the entire block. However, if that reference row is at the edge, it looks like they don\u2019t propagate its pattern. The reference rows need to strictly be internal, not the first or last in the block. So I'm thinking about how examples fit into these rules.",
