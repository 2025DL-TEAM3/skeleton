For example, in input1, the values are visually encoded, with certain patterns emerging like the counts of '3's. \n\nLet\u2019s note the structure of a 5x5 grid and see if a 3x3 window reveals more about the colors. The grid seems to show a concentration of '3's in the center. I\u2019ll consider how this might relate to detecting unique locations or bounding boxes.**Exploring grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the central rows and columns of my grid to find distinct patterns. For instance, rows 2-4 and columns 2-4 include some '3's but also a '0' and '5'. So maybe I should look for the largest filled region of '3's.\n\nIt seems I won\u2019t find a pure 3x3 block. However, I could investigate the unique '0' at (4,2) or the other odd entries in the grids. There\u2019s got to be some way to map these outliers and identify their locations!**Identifying grid shapes**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the output of my grid, focusing on how the first row shows '2's and a '7' in the third position. The input grid, being 10x4, may need compression to fit into a smaller 3x3 format. \n\nI\u2019m thinking about marking non-'7' cells and observing how they form shapes. The irregular pattern makes it tricky to reduce them to a 3x3 area. It could help to find the least common color or the overall bounding shape of the colored regions. For instance, colors could serve as markers, with the output showing how those regions connect visibly.",
