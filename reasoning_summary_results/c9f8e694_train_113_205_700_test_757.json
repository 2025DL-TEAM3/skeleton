    "reasoning": "**Analyzing color propagation**\n\nI'm pondering the idea of colored pattern \"stems\" in the first column that spread horizontally. For example, a '9' in column 1 of row 4 spreads to fill all '4s' in that row. However, in training1, while the left column for rows 2-8 is zero, they still fill with the pattern from row 1 instead of zero. This seems to suggest that they fill regions using values from the row above them. It appears consistent that the regions fill according to the pattern directly above them.**Examining pattern propagation**\n\nIn row 3, I\u2019m considering whether it uses the original input or an updated overlay. It looks like they use row 1 as a source for propagation instead of filling with the original row 2's fives. In training2, even though the row 1 pattern is made of zeros, the output isn't consistent since they fill with nines instead. \n\nWhen assessing training3, I see input shapes showing blocks of 3s, particularly in columns 4 to 6. Understanding how these patterns interact reveals the different propagation strategies used across training sets.**Exploring training variations**\n\nI'm considering how different training sets use various filling rules. Training1 appears to use row 1 as its source, while training2 utilizes the row above each block, and training3 seems to rely on the leftward row. It seems like the filling direction depends on whether the block is horizontal or vertical. For instance, training1 fills from above if the row has non-zero values, while training2 shifts left when the above row has zeros. My hypothesis is to fill from the nearest non-zero neighbor, prioritizing directions like up and left.",
