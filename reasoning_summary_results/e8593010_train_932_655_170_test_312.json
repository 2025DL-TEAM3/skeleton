The goal is to identify the transformation rule from these examples and apply it to a test input. Each example consists of a grid of digit characters, and my outputs will be grids of the same size. I'll start by rewriting these examples in an easier format to understand the transformations better. Let's see how this goes!**Structuring example inputs**\n\nI have an example format for an ARC puzzle. The first input grid is 8 rows by 9 columns, showing a pattern of digits. My goal is to analyze this grid and identify how the output grid transforms based on the established pattern. \n\nThe output grid is composed of numbers that represent the transformation from the input. Now, I\u2019ll also consider a second input grid of size 6x10 for further analysis. Let\u2019s see how the transformation goes!**Analyzing transformations and patterns**\n\nI'm looking at example inputs with grids containing two colors\u2014background and shapes. For each example, the output seems to reflect counts of neighboring pixels. For instance, in the first example, the background is one color while shapes are represented by another. The output shows either numbers indicating adjacency counts or maintains the original background color. \n\nI suspect the output marks clusters of neighboring pixels, counting connections or components. I need to verify how diagonals or contiguities affect output values, possibly revealing insights into shape arrangements and orientations. Let's break this down!",
