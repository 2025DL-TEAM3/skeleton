    "reasoning": "**Analyzing number propagation**\n\nI'm examining how the numbers 2 and 3 influence changes in a grid. I have training examples where the presence of these numbers seems to trigger the appearance of 8 in nearby cells. In the example provided, I can see that when a '3' appears in the input, the cells directly beneath it change to '8' in the output. For instance, the input has a '3' at (1,2) and it leads to an '8' at (2,2) in the output. Interesting!**Examining vertical patterns**\n\nIt looks like I\u2019m analyzing how numbers 2 and 3 affect vertical patterns in a grid. I\u2019m observing that in certain positions, a vertical stripe of 8s appears below a 3 while a 2 can cause changes in adjacent columns. In the example, the 2 at (2,2) leads to 8s below it at (3,2) and so on. For the 3, I see it at (6,4), which also changes values below it, aligning with the patterns I\u2019m looking into. This is quite interesting!**Determining L-shaped paths**\n\nI'm analyzing how to create an L-shaped path between the numbers 2 and 3 in a grid. The rules I\u2019ve identified involve moving horizontally from the position of the 2 to align with the column of the 3, then moving vertically to the row of the 3. I must change the values along this path while excluding the starting point (2) and the endpoint (3).\n\nIn the provided grid, the path starts at (6,3) and ends at (3,1). I need to include intermediate points and ensure I correctly follow the rules set up in previous examples. The path includes points at (6,2) and (6,1), and then I continue upwards to (5,1) and (4,1), making sure to exclude the endpoint (3,1). Let's finalize this!**Defining path changes**\n\nI\u2019m working on defining how to change values along an L-shaped path between the numbers 2 and 3 in a grid. First, I identify the horizontal points, ensuring I exclude the starting point. Then, I determine the vertical points while avoiding duplicates. After identifying these, I realize the rule states that while changing 4s to 8s, I might need to change any non-marker cell on the path to 8 as well. So I\u2019ll update all relevant grid positions accordingly. Now, let\u2019s generate the updated grid!",
