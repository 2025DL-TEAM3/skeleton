Moving on, 45526 changes to 48826, and 64542 turns into 64842. It seems like the pattern holds! Now for the second test, like 843232 to 543232, where '8' is replaced with '5'. I look at other numbers with '8' as well, confirming that they follow the replacement rules consistently. Good! Now, what's the next example to test?**Determining digit swaps**\n\nI'm analyzing several input-output pairs to identify the underlying rules. For instance, 22222 remains unchanged, while 52252 turns into 82282 with '5' swapped for '8'. The same directional change occurs with 85258 becoming 58285, revealing a swap pattern. \n\nThrough these examples, I discover a consistent rule: if only '5's or '8's are present, they replace each other accordingly. When both exist, they swap. I conclude that the task's rule is to swap '5' and '8' consistently across all inputs, maintaining everything else.**Applying digit swaps to input grid**\n\nI\u2019m working with the following input grid:\n\n```\n889\n579\n938\n```\n\nWhen I swap '5' and '8', I get:\n\n- For Row 1: 8 becomes 5, leading to 559.\n- For Row 2: 5 changes to 8, resulting in 879.\n- For Row 3: 8 turns into 5, producing 935.\n\nSo the final output grid looks like this:\n\n```\n559\n879\n935\n```\n\nI\u2019m double-checking that it all aligns correctly!",
