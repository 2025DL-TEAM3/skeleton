    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC Puzzle**\n\nI\u2019m looking at an ARC puzzle that involves mapping input grids to output grids. There are three examples to parse, starting with the first input grid. It's 7 rows by 10 columns, and I'm noticing some colored digits: 7, 6, and 4. It seems like there's a pattern where rows and columns are filled with alternating digits, likely 5 and 7 for the areas with 7s, and similar for 6s and 4s. I\u2019ll need to keep track of the positions of these colored cells as I analyze further.**Establishing Filling Rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how many digits there are in the grid. There are 10, and the non-zero digits are positioned at specific columns. I see that in each row that has exactly one non-zero cell, I should fill zeros to the right of that cell with an alternating pattern, starting with the seed digit and then 5, leaving other spaces untouched.\n\nFor the next example, I've identified seed digits in various rows and confirmed how the output rules apply. It looks consistent, alternating between the seed and 5 based on the rules I\u2019ve outlined so far.**Finalizing Grid Transformation**\n\nIn the analysis of the grid, I identified that col3 has a seed digit of 7 in \"44474,\" and wondered about the replacement rules. It seems that to the right of the seed, everything is alternately filled, even if there are non-zero digits. For example, in row1 \"44448,\" no changes occurred since there's no rightward space to fill. \n\nNow examining the grid with the background value of 4, only row3 has a seed at col3=2. This leads to a final output of \"444252\" for that row, confirming our predicted output grid remains consistent. Thus, the complete grid will be:\n\n444444  \n444444  \n444444  \n444252",
