The first example has a single input row repeated, which sets a straightforward pattern. The second example shows vertical mirroring: I reverse the rows and then list them in order again. The third example follows the same logic, reinforcing the idea of taking rows in reverse order before repeating them in their original sequence. I need to apply this rule to any new input provided.**Explaining the grid transformation**\n\nThe rule for this puzzle is that for any input grid with n rows, I need to output a grid of 2n rows. First, I take the original rows and reverse their order, then follow it up with the original order again, keeping the same number of columns. For example, with the provided input of four rows, I'll list them twice\u2014first in reverse and then in original order\u2014resulting in eight rows total. I'll ensure the output is clear and correctly formatted.",
