When I reverse input r6, it should yield \"2422222.\" However, I need to double-check that the original input data for row 6 is correct before proceeding with further calculations.**Confirming output rows**\n\nI'm working through a set of input lines and calculating their outputs by reversing the rows. \n\nChecking row 6, which is \"2222242,\" confirmed, I can derive output rows. For instance, output r0 is \"2422222,\" coming from reversing row 6. \n\nFor other rows like r1, r2, r3, and so on, I'm ensuring each output matches after reversing the original inputs and checking that I'm capturing the correct values and structure.
