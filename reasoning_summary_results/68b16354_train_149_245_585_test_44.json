    "reasoning": "**Reversing Row Order in Grids**\n\nThe task involves taking a grid of strings and outputting the rows in reversed order. For example, given input rows like 7799177747, the output should simply be the rows restructured as: 4729717777, and so forth. The same applies to other examples provided, where each set of rows is reversed without altering their internal structure. For a new input like 05, 00, and so on, the final output grid will look like: 40, 50, 00, 09, 00, 05, ensuring proper formatting with each entry on a separate line.**Confirming Output Format**\n\nThe final output grid will be:  \n40  \n50  \n00  \n09  \n00  \n05  \n\nI double-checked the previous examples, and they consistently reversed the order of rows, so this should be correct. I remember to avoid extra spaces as well. Additionally, I considered leading zeros; '00' remains '00', and '09' stays '09', while 40 and 50 have no leading zeros. Everything checks out, so I think I\u2019m ready to proceed with this final answer.",
