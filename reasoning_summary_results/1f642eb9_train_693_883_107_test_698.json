    "reasoning": "**Determining transformation rules**\n\nI need to figure out the transformation rule based on three training sets. The first three sets are 9x9, and then I have a third one that's 8 rows by 6 columns. That\u2019s a bit different! Now, the new test set I\u2019m working with is 9 rows and 7 columns. It\u2019s interesting to see how these varied dimensions can influence the transformation rules I'll derive. Let\u2019s explore how I can apply the transformations effectively.**Revising training data**\n\nI'm working on rewriting the first training set. The input is a 9x9 structure where I notice some consistent values, like many nines. For the output, I see changes in certain rows, particularly in row three where zeros change to threes. I need to compare the inputs and outputs to pinpoint patterns. For example, in row five, the zero changes to a two, and in row six, the zero switches to a six. I\u2019m piecing it all together carefully to ensure accuracy!**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the output grid where rows four and five change based on border anomalies. For row four, the output is \"0409444,\" and for row five, it\u2019s \"4439444.\" The rest remain unchanged. I want to verify how border anomalies affect zeros in various regions and see if that concept holds for the training data. After testing, it looks like the final output grid correctly aligns. I\u2019ll ensure everything is formatted clearly as lines for the final presentation!",
