    "reasoning": "**Analyzing counting rules**\n\nI\u2019m counting occurrences of numbers in a grid. So, 5 appears 26 times: breaking it down by rows. Meanwhile, 4 shows up only 4 times. That makes 4 the minority color, but they marked 5 positions instead. Wait, could it mean they always mark the majority color? Actually, maybe they just always mark shape 5. It seems all inputs contain either 2 or 5, or 4 and 5, with 5 being consistent. So, I should consistently focus on digit 5 for marking positions.**Clarifying marking rules**\n\nThe highest value in the inputs is 5, leading to a rule that states I should mark all pixels equal to the maximum digit and replace them with the minimum digit. For examples one and three, the minimum digit is 2, while in the second example, it's 4. So, they replace maximum digits with minimum digits, writing zeros elsewhere. \n\nFor the test input using digits 5 and 6, the maximum is 6 and the minimum is 5. The rule indicates that I should mark each 6's position with 5. Hence, I fill the grid with 5s at positions of 6, and zeros where there are 5s.**Validating output grid**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing the test input rows carefully. For each row, I'm translating the inputs to outputs based on the marking rules discussed. \n\nFor instance, row 1 (65666) becomes 50555, while row 2 (66566) converts to 55055. I need to ensure that the outputs reflect zeros in the right places, like in row 4 (00050). After verifying all rows, the final grid outputs look correct: \n\n```\n50555\n55055\n55055\n00050\n50055\n55555\n00500\n05555\n55000\n50000\n```\n\nNow, I\u2019m ready to return that grid!",
