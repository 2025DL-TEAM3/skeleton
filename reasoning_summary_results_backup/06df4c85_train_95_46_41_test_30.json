    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the ARC style puzzle**\n\nI'm examining a grid transformation puzzle with three examples showing both input and output grids. The first example has rows where some numbers change and others stay the same. For instance, in the output, the 7 in row 3 becomes a 9, suggesting that specific positions change depending on their placement. \n\nThis seems to indicate a pattern where odd numbers may be altered, particularly within a cross shape, focusing on specific positions. I need to determine how the changes occur based on this reasoning.**Mapping changed positions**\n\nI'm analyzing which positions change across the rows in a grid. In Example 1, I'm considering a 9x7 grid. It seems that changed cells are limited to a few spots.\n\nFor instance, row 3 has changes at columns 3 and 5, where input 7 changes to 9. Row 5 also changes at column 1, which might indicate a pattern in odd rows. \n\nI'll note the modified positions as (3,3), (3,5), and (5,1). Row 7 and others remain unchanged, which is interesting since it highlights specific locations that are affected. Mapping this visually could provide further insight into the transformation.**Identifying grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m constructing a grid with repeating motifs of 7s and 8s, along with some 9s positioned in specific rows. Rows 3 and 7 have 9s prominently placed at column 1, affecting the overall pattern. \n\nIn the output, row 3 transforms to entirely 9s in odd positions, while row 7 remains unchanged, hinting at an asymmetrical arrangement. \n\nFor the second grid, it looks like 2s are being replaced by 0s or 8s based on their context, particularly in rows where they appear, which indicates a certain color boundary or shape influence at play.",
