It seems like there's a transformation happening on each row, along with a permutation.\n\nFor instance, the first input row 0220 matches with the output row seven. Meanwhile, input row two, 0090, transforms to output row six as 0900, indicating a digit rotation. I'm wondering if generally, each input row becomes its corresponding output row, in reverse order, after applying this rotation. Let's check further!**Understanding the puzzle transformation**\n\nI'm analyzing this puzzle, noting that transformations occur with each row. For instance, rotating 0090 right doesn't quite work out, but if I cyclic shift it, I see output at row six as 0,9,0,0\u2014indicating a right shift. \n\nAs I dig deeper, reversing seems to be key since numbers like 4900 become 0094 backwards. I think the rule requires each row's digits to be reversed while also changing the order of the rows themselves. It\u2019s almost like rotating the entire grid 180 degrees.**Transforming rows for the grid**\n\nI\u2019m working through a grid transformation where I reverse the order of rows and also reverse the digits within each row. For instance, input row 1 is 277727, which when reversed becomes 727772 and ends up as output row 5. \n\nFollowing the same process, I confirm that each row matches its target output after reversing both the order and the digits. After carefully checking all calculations, I end up with the final output grid:\n\n634077  \n778778  \n577777  \n613571  \n727772",
