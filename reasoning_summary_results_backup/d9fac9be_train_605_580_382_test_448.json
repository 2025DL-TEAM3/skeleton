For fives, I see they\u2019re represented in different rows, totaling seven occurrences, not five. Then, I'm checking for sixes, realizing there are several as well. I find inconsistencies in counts; for instance, rows contain multiple sixes. When seeking unique digits, I note that \u20185\u2019 appears only once in a few rows. I start to investigate a possible pattern or diagonal formation among the fives, noting their specific positions.**Examining digit shapes**\n\nI'm considering the anti-diagonal positions and their sums. There's an interesting idea that the 6s might outline a shape, while the 5s mark holes within it. It\u2019s like recognizing digits formed by these specific colors against a field of zeros. In a different example, the digits 4, 1, and 0 seem to create square shapes with 0s as blank spaces. The third example introduces a grid packed with 6s that form a block and might represent holes or outlines for the other digits. The count is tricky; it feels like I'm deciphering shapes reminiscent of numbers.**Finding the missing digit**\n\nI'm trying to determine which digit is missing in the input to create a cohesive pattern. The outputs seem tied to the smallest or middle digits present. In the first example, we get 5, while the second outputs 0, which feels like it chooses the smallest due to counts of digits being crucial in examples. \n\nThen, I analyze the counts across multiple rows, realizing 4 appears most often while 0s and 1s are tied. So in case of a tie, they lean toward the smallest.**Identifying the least frequent digit**\n\nI\u2019m tasked with finding the least frequently occurring digit in a 7x7 grid. The input includes digits 1, 5, and 9. I need to count the occurrences of each digit based on the rows and then determine the least common one. \n\nAfter tallying them up, I see that 1 appears 12 times, 5 appears 25 times, and 9 also appears 12 times. Both 1 and 9 are tied, but since 1 is the smallest digit, that will be the output. So, I\u2019ll simply output \"1\".",
