    "reasoning": "**Clarifying region outputs**\n\nIn region A, which is structured with 2 rows and 10 columns, the output remains constant across both rows, showing \"9995222259.\" This indicates that within a region, all rows output the same sequence. Similarly, in region B, rows 4 through 8 all yield \"4445666653.\" This means the entire block has a repeated 10-digit pattern for each of its rows. The rule is simple: for any block of identical rows, the output will be the same but transformed. The transformation process maps digits based on the count of rows in the block.**Examining digit mappings**\n\nI\u2019m reviewing how the digit \u20185\u2019 remains constant across all outputs, appearing in regions A, B, and C. For region B, it was at positions 3 and 8, and it didn\u2019t change. Now, the mapping for the original digit \u20189\u2019 seems dependent on the length of segments within the region. For example, segments of 9 in region B change based on their length: those with three 9\u2019s become 4, while four 9\u2019s become 6. In contrast, region A shows an odd mapping where a segment of four 9\u2019s changes to 2. I see a pattern suggesting mapping depends on segment length and region size, which creates inconsistencies.**Analyzing block mappings**\n\nI'm examining how to treat each cell in the blocks based on original digit values of 9 or 5. For instances where an entire row is 5, some rows remain unchanged, like the all-5 rows at position 2 and 8. The mapping for 9 cells could relate to the vertical distance to the nearest all-5 row. In region A, only the largest segments of 9 are replaced by block height unless they\u2019re smaller. Similar logic applies in other regions but with inconsistencies in outcomes. There might be a pattern based on segment lengths and heights that drives these mappings.**Reviewing sample patterns**\n\nI'm examining sample3 with the input pattern of 779777977 across multiple rows. Here, the separators are rows of 9s, with segments of 7s to transform. When transforming, the top and bottom blocks only change the middle segments, while the middle block modifies all segments based on their lengths. The transformations apply consistently: outer segments remain the same, and the middle segments change according to predefined rules. This ensures that the output maintains the segmented structure while applying uniform transformations where needed.",
