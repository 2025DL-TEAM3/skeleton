    "reasoning": "**Calculating input details**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a data grid with 7 rows and 10 columns. I see clusters at various positions like (1,1), (1,10), and (7,10). The first block sums up to 6 from positions in different rows, while additional rows add more to the total, bringing it to 14. The grid appears to have some colored points, with background and foreground distinctions, so I\u2019ll need to confirm those specifics to ensure clarity on positions and counts.**Analyzing cluster patterns**\n\nI\u2019m examining a grid to identify clusters of color 5 while keeping background color three in mind. I need to isolate different clusters of 5s that aren\u2019t overshadowed by the background. First, I\u2019ll track occurrences of 5s around significant input points, like (1,1). In the localized 3x3 area, I see positions (1,1), (1,3), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), and (3,3), totaling six distinct points, which forms a recognizable cluster pattern. I\u2019ll apply this concept to other clusters as needed.**Examining cluster patterns and orientations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing input patterns, starting with identifying a 3x3 block where different clusters appear. The focus is on how clusters of colors, like 5s and 4s, align and potentially mirror around certain points. For cluster 4s located at the block's right edge, I'll identify their positions and offsets. It seems that their orientation changes based on the pixel's location within the grid. This suggests how patterns can differ structurally when they are positioned left, right, or in the center of the block. I'll keep exploring these relationships for accuracy.**Analyzing seed patterns and offsets**\n\nI'm examining seed clusters for their mirrored patterns in various grid sections, particularly for bottom-left and bottom-right seeds. The bottom-left cluster uses offsets from a vertically mirrored pattern. The bottom-right entails both horizontal and vertical mirroring as well. After calculating these offsets, I realize I need to check if certain cell positions are consistent with the original patterns extracted from input seeds. I suspect there are additional clusters that aren't fully covered, and next, I need to clarify how those patterns overlap with the existing seeds.",
