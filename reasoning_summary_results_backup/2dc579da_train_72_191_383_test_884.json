    "reasoning": "**Evaluating color shapes**\n\nI'm analyzing non-background colors, 3 and 7, and figuring out how to isolate their unique shapes. My goal is to extract minimal bounding rectangles for these shapes and output them vertically. For example, the bounding box for color 7 has some specific dimensions, but I realize there's a complexity with color 3 since it may not form a perfect rectangle. I could also look for shapes that appear exactly twice in the grid. Still, the output requires making those rectangles.**Exploring grid patterns**\n\nSo, I'm noticing a pattern in the input grid that seems symmetric, possibly with repeated quarter patterns. My job is to reconstruct a missing section from that. In example 3, the output displays two blocks\u2014a 2x2 of 7s on top and a 2x2 of 3s below\u2014matching specific rows and columns in the input. But it raises questions about where the 7s came from since they are placed above the 3s in the output. I have to map out the blocks of 5s and how they relate to the overall shapes in the output.**Analyzing color clusters**\n\nI'm examining the coordinates for the color 7, which forms clusters in specific positions. There are two clusters, with one block of 4 along one column but with some gaps. It seems I need to identify if these shapes form rectangular regions or not. If other colors create irregular shapes, then I should focus on connected components that are fully filled rectangles. In earlier examples, the largest filled rectangles were extracted, and it makes sense they would prioritize those. I need to find matching rectangular shapes across colors, too.**Determining output grid**\n\nI'm analyzing the clusters for colors 7 and 5 in the grid. I confirm the 2x1 block of 7s was expected, but the output seems to show something different: a vertical mix of 7 and 5. That feels odd because I anticipated a uniform block of 7. The dimensions and orientations might cause confusion\u2014maybe they opted for a 1x2 arrangement instead. However, example 3 leads me to a straightforward conclusion: the output clearly fits a 2x2 pattern, which gives the grid:\n\n55  \n55  \n00  \n00  \n\nSo that will be my final answer.",
