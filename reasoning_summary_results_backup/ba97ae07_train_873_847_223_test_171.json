    "reasoning": "**Analyzing color patterns**\n\nI'm exploring how rows 4 to 6, which have the values '393', can form a rectangle when looking at colors. The idea is to fill the central region (currently 9) with the border color (which is 3), resulting in '333'. The outer rows, represented by '292', remain unchanged. It seems that I'm identifying a pattern where I have three rows and three columns, with only the middle column having 9 while the others have 3. This shape could effectively be filled in a specified way.**Understanding color filling in patterns**\n\nI see a vertical stripe of 9's shaped as (3x1) embedded within a 3x3 block of 3's. The goal is to fill this region entirely with 3's. For instance, in the input '5511555555', the third row '9911999999' changes to '9999999999'. This row contains a pattern where 1's sit flanked by 9's, forming a rectangle. The 9's replace differing colors based on the majority pattern, creating a uniform background. I notice a frame structure, where border colors encapsulate a different central color.**Clarifying color transformation in examples**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing example 1, where the background colors are 4 and 8, with rows 6 and 7 containing some 3's. It looks like an 8x9 grid where a central rectangle shaped by rows 6 and 7 has a border of 8's and an interior of 3's. The transformation fills the 3's with the border color 8, turning the entire row into 8's.\n\nIn examining examples, I note that the process turns minority colors into the majority color within rows that show two distinct colors. For instance, in example 3, the original row is '9911999999' where 9's are predominant, converting 1's to 9's. This suggests that only rows with distinct colors are modified while keeping the majority pattern in other rows intact.",
