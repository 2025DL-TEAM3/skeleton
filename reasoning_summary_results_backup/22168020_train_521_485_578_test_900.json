    "reasoning": "**Generalizing the pattern**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a puzzle from ARC with input-output examples. The first input set is a series of numbers where each digit row maps to an output row. Notably, in the second example, the last two digits change. It seems that when a 9 appears, it turns subsequent 5s into 9s. That might be the pattern: whenever a 9 is present, it propagates to the neighboring digits. I\u2019ll continue to examine the rest of the rows and confirm this rule.**Deciphering the propagation rule**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the outputs for various input sequences, focusing on how certain digits change. The latest sequence involves 9s and 5s, where it seems the position and proximity influence whether a number turns to another. For instance, 9s near the center might become 5s, while 5s near it could change to 9s. In the subsequent example with 1s and 7s, it appears that when a 7 is present, it propagates leftwards, altering the preceding digits. I'll need to quantify this change based on span.**Analyzing diamond patterns**\n\nI\u2019m decoding a filled diamond shape pattern from the output. In the first example, 9s create a diamond as they cover certain columns based on their positions. In the second example with 5s, a similar pattern appears, forming an inverse diamond shape. The output seems to fill the inner areas based on these borders. It looks like the approach to filling these shapes might be inconsistent, where minority numbers get filled within their bounding area. I\u2019ll need to clarify the rules for determining which digit fills the structure.**Reviewing diamond propagation**\n\nI\u2019m considering the structure of a diamond shape in a grid. The center is at row 4, but I think the apex might be broader than one point because of even width. It feels like the shape could be more of a parallelogram than a diamond based on the edges shown. \n\nI also think about how to propagate colors like 8, where I can fill out diagonals until they hit grid borders. The output, however, might just match the input since there\u2019s no interior to fill in this case. So, I\u2019ll conclude my output should reflect the same grid as the input.",
