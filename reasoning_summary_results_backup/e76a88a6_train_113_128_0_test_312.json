It seems like the mapping isn't consistent just by digit values, but might depend on the context or orientation of neighboring values. The 5s could be forming pattern shapes, perhaps resembling L-shapes. The input grid has a background (1) and a pattern (5) that transforms, suggesting a more complex relationship.**Mapping clusters in the grid**\n\nIn the first example, I notice a symmetrical pattern of 5s in rows 2, 3, and 4 that seem to form L shapes. These shapes might be replaced by the digits 9, 6, or 8 based on their orientation. Starting from the input grid, I mark the positions of the 5s and find clusters in adjacent rows. \n\nI can list coordinates based on adjacency to identify clusters of 5s, allowing me to map them effectively. The clusters appear consistently in rows 2 and 3, suggesting an interesting relationship.**Interpreting cluster shapes**\n\nI'm analyzing the clusters formed by points at specific coordinates in the grid. The significant structure emerges in row 3, where I see a Tetris-like shape resembling a \"P\" or \"9.\" When I look at the output values, they correspond to the positions where 5s appeared before, which implies a pattern replacement. \n\nIt's interesting how these digit shapes formed might represent segments of actual numbers. Cluster B, for instance, forms a diagonal or an L shape, which could represent a 7-segment display. This interpretation suggests that the layout may reflect actual pixel values of digits.",
