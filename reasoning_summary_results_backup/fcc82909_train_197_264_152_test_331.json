    "reasoning": "**Analyzing example patterns**\n\nI need to identify a rule based on the three examples given and then apply that rule to a new input. First, I\u2019ll clarify the specifics: in the examples, rows 1-4 are identical, rows 5 and 6 are also the same, and then row 7 changes from all 6s to something else. The critical change happens in columns 3-4, where \"99\" gets replaced by \"33\" in row 7. I'm curious how this process holds for example two and others.**Examining row changes**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how the row patterns work, focusing on rows 6-7, which form a specific shape influenced by surrounding values. In these rows, columns 5-6 show \u201c1\u201d and \u201c6,\u201d creating a pattern. This visual takes a colored shape that extends vertically, but interestingly, it only fills one row below the block instead of two. It raises questions about why one row was altered in one example but two in another. I wonder what rules dictate these changes.**Investigating block replacement rules**\n\nI'm trying to understand the rules for filling colors based on shapes in the grid. For example, in a 7x7 grid from example 3, rows 4-5 show a block with \"5\" and \"6.\" They replaced rows 6 and 7 by putting two \"3s\" in the same columns, following the pattern directly below. This leads me to question why another example only replaced row 7 and left row 8 unchanged. It seems like they might avoid touching borders or filling rows with the same background color, which feels a bit inconsistent. I\u2019ll keep exploring this!",
