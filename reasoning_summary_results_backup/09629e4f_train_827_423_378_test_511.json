For example, in column one, it seems the minimum value is utilized, but the second column output is puzzling. Although both inputs from the first two rows were the same, the output is unexpected. The mapping doesn't seem to be straightforward, leading to some confusion on how the outputs are derived consistently across the columns.**Analyzing Input Patterns**\n\nI\u2019m breaking down the input for the example. For each column, I\u2019m looking at the values from the first two rows and the last two. It seems I might need to identify distinct digits and their frequencies to understand the output better. Interestingly, it appears these shapes represent digits like 1, 4, and 7 against a background of 9s. \n\nThis gives me a hypothesis that I should focus on the most frequent colors in the top half, possibly selecting two largest identifiable shapes for the output.**Evaluating Cluster Mapping**\n\nI'm considering how to properly swap cluster mappings in the example. For instance, in Example 1, both bottom clusters show a certain consistency with the number 4. Meanwhile, Example 3 results in zero values, while Example 2 shows a variety with 7 and 1. It feels complicated, but maybe I should prioritize using the simplest symmetric fill. Given that, I\u2019ll propose an output of 66066 for clarity across the grid, with emphasis on maintaining symmetry and majority representation.",
