    "reasoning": "**Mapping changes in row 3**\n\nI see that row 3 changes from its original: 8, 2, 8, 2, 2, 2, 9, 7, 2, 9 to the output 8, 8, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, 9. I\u2019m trying to figure out how each position transforms. It looks like position 2 changes from 2 to 8, position 3 goes from 8 to 2, etc. I realize that I need to ensure I keep an accurate count of the numbers, and it feels puzzling to keep track of all these changes and mappings!**Analyzing grid transformations**\n\nI\u2019m trying to figure out if the pattern involves swapping quadrants or reflecting shapes. The grid seems to contain rounded shapes, and blocks of constant 2 values are replaced at certain positions. For example, in row 2, the sequence 8222222229 has a rectangle of 2s, but the output changes some of those to 7s. For row 4, almost the entire row transforms to 2s with some 8s and 9s, suggesting a color-swapping transformation. I need to focus more on how these shapes interact!**Exploring fill rules for interior colors**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to fill the interior of a shape based on the nearest border color. For each interior pixel, I have to find the closest border by calculating the distances to the top, bottom, left, and right borders. For instance, for a pixel at (row 2, col 3), the nearest is up, which means that color replaces it. However, if the pixel is already the same as the border color, it stays unchanged. This process seems to focus on filling in holes or replicating the frame's colors inward while managing existing colors. I need to dig deeper into how these distances affect the final output!",
