The training data shows an input of \"556655666,\" resulting in \"660066000.\" I notice that the input consists of rows with numbers 5 and 6, while the output uses 0 and 6. It seems positions with 5 map to 6 and those with 6 map to 0. For instance, the first row confirms this relationship, where 5 turns into 6 and 6 into 0. This pattern holds for subsequent rows too.**Establishing mapping rules**\n\nI've identified a clear rule for mapping digits in these ARC puzzles: map the smaller digit to the larger one, and the larger digit to zero. In the first example with inputs of 5 and 6, 5 maps to 6, and 6 maps to 0. Next, with inputs of 9 and 5, 9 becomes 0 and 5 becomes 9. The approach is consistent; I need to determine the two distinct values in the input and apply these mappings systematically to generate the output. It's about keeping the mappings clear and straightforward!",
