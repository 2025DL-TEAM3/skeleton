    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle rules**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the pattern in the ARC puzzle based on the given examples. It seems the outputs mainly increment some digits while keeping others unchanged. In the first example, only the last digit of the first two rows changed. Specifically, the first row increased its last digit from 0 to 1, while the second row changed from 9501 to 9511 at the fourth last position. Rows three and beyond stayed the same. Understanding this consistent pattern seems essential for solving it!**Analyzing Example 2**\n\nI'm breaking down the transformations in Example 2 of the puzzle. It looks like there's a systematic pattern where zeros in certain positions within the rows are being changed to ones, particularly from positions three to seven. The boundaries seem to stay intact while the interior values change. For instance, in the first row, zeros in specific columns are replaced by ones, while some values, like column positions that initially had non-zero numbers, remain unchanged. This appears consistent across rows one through seven, but the eighth row mostly stays the same except where zeros appear.**Identifying shapes in grids**\n\nI'm examining a grid where non-zero values form a border around zeros, suggesting a shape that encloses an area. In the provided examples, I see that the pattern is similar across different scenarios. The goal is to identify a continuous border of non-zero values and then fill any zeros within this boundary with ones. For the test input, I'll map the non-zeros visually and confirm the connectivity of the border. Once identified, I can transform the interior zeros into ones, effectively filling that enclosed area.**Exploring connectivity and filling**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the condition for changing zeros in the grid based on the sum of their row and column indices. From my observations, it seems that examples aren't consistent since some thresholds include values below the expected range. In example three, it appears diagonal connectivity led to more interior zeros being filled. I think I\u2019ll proceed using a flood fill approach with 4-connectivity to change unreachable zeros, focusing only on the test input, which has limited interior zeros. It looks like the output will reflect this approach!",
