    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the ARC task**\n\nThe task involves understanding and transforming input grids into output grids based on learned rules. I\u2019ll start by examining the training examples, which mainly feature numbers rather than colors. \n\nFor instance, the first example consists of a ring of 6\u2019s surrounded by zeros, with a smaller inner pattern of 1\u2019s and 6\u2019s. I\u2019ll represent these as grids, identifying coordinates and mapping specific cells that change to create the output. This breakdown will help create a clearer way to identify patterns.**Examining output transformations**\n\nThe output maintains the ring of 6s with some changes in a peripheral 5x5 region. Looking more closely, the original grid featured 1s forming a pattern that changed to 6s and 1s in the output. Each row is considered, and I see that the internal region's transformation leads to some rotation or symmetry in the output.\n\nInterestingly, the pattern of 1s is now positioned differently, with three 1s in the output, implying a rotation or reflection effect on the initial grid's 1s.**Identifying connected components**\n\nIn this example, I\u2019m counting the 7s in the output grid. They appear in various rows and columns. It appears that the key rule here is to find the largest connected component of a non-background color and transfer that pattern to the border of the grid, effectively transforming its shape.\n\nThe 1s and 6s denote anomalies within the primary background, and these shapes are mapped onto the perimeter, creating a connection between the inner and outer regions while maintaining the original structure. I'll continue verifying the input positions to ensure accuracy.**Understanding anomaly projection**\n\nI\u2019m thinking about how to project anomalies to the nearest border. For example, if I have an anomaly at (1,4), I need to determine its closest border cell based on direction. The problem lies in connecting these projected points accurately; sometimes it feels a bit messy. I notice that the counts of anomalies in a row or column might be more effective for determining where to place them on the border. \n\nI\u2019m realizing that the shape and boundary need to be clearly defined, and maybe grouping anomalies can help manage their projections better. This process is definitely complex but exciting to explore!**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI\u2019m processing the input rows to create a grid output. Starting with row 4, I remove the anomalies, resulting in \"599999995\". I check each row for consistency and find the grid looks like this:\n\n222552222\n299999992\n299999992\n299999992\n599999995\n299999992\n299999992\n\nI\u2019m also reflecting on the previous examples for patterns in column and row maxima. The algorithm seems stable, identifying local maxima where applicable, and properly adjusting for global maxima when necessary. Yes, the final output aligns with the training examples, so I think it\u2019s good to go!",
