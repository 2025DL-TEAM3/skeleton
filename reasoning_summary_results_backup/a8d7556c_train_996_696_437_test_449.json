    "reasoning": "**Analyzing shape transformation**\n\nI'm thinking about how the shape replaces some 0s with 2s in regions defined by 9s. It looks like it identifies contiguous areas of background zeros among the colored 9s and fills those areas. This seems quite interesting! I\u2019ll need to analyze example one more closely to understand the specifics of the transformation and how it works. I'm eager to dig deeper and uncover the details!**Evaluating grid transformation**\n\nLooking at the input grid, the transformation replaces certain 0s with 2s based on their location relative to the 9s. For example, in some rows like R2 and R3, all zeros turn to 2s, while others leave some unchanged due to their position. It seems like the 2s appear where contiguous background zeros are surrounded by 9s, indicating a connected region. I'll need to analyze this further to fully understand the boundaries of these regions and the specific transformations.**Identifying regions of transformation**\n\nI\u2019m exploring how the zeros transform into 2s and collecting their coordinates. The arrangement suggests a diagonal staircase pattern, but it appears that the zeros fill enclosed areas within an S-shaped path formed by the 9s. This continuous shape surrounds certain zeros, marking those as the holes filled with 2s. I need to determine which zero clusters are connected and entirely encapsulated by this shape, leaving the zeros outside the shape unchanged. The 9s seem to define a closed loop, allowing some zero regions to touch the grid boundary while still being considered enclosed.",
