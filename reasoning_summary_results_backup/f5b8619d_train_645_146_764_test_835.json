Looking at the puzzle presented, it seems to reflect something diagonal, but I'm unsure about that. \n\nAnalyzing the provided input leads me to see how each row translates into a specific output format with scaling involved: it doubles the rows and columns, mapping zeros and fives to new values. Each row's transformation suggests an interesting way to manipulate the original data for a clearer representation.**Exploring pixel transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing which positions change to 8, focusing on the 3rd position and beyond, while noting exceptions for original non-zero values. In various rows, I observe how the positions adjust based on the values\u2014specifically looking for patterns of zeros and fives. I wonder if I should try creating a vertical line of 8's to distinguish between different regions. I also consider finding the bounding box for zeros or non-fives and reflecting patterns to create symmetry in the output. This might yield a neat transformation mapping each input row to a modified output effectively.**Analyzing shape transformations**\n\nI'm delving into how certain positions change to 8, particularly examining shapes formed by threes and other numbers. It seems the changes occur based on proximity to other non-three values and possibly in a diagonal or inward pressing pattern. In my exploration of example inputs, I see a consistent mapping rule: threes to the right of the first non-three cell transform into eights. The resulting pattern creates an 'hourglass' shape in the output, which gets duplicated for symmetry, enhancing the overall representation.",
