It seems I need to figure out the rule by examining the training example more closely.\n\nIn the first example, I need to identify the matrix and coordinate positions. The input shows mostly 2s with a few exceptions in specific locations that I'll focus on. I\u2019ll take more time to check those special digit placements to understand the transformation better.**Mapping patterns in grid output**\n\nThe output grid showcases values that include many 6s, 5s, and 0s. I\u2019m trying to find a possible diamond or circle pattern centered around certain points. \n\nIn examining row and column positions, I noticed that certain digits form special points that seem to create a quadrilateral shape. The numbers 5 form a cross, and it looks like the arrangement within a rectangle is a rotated pattern.\n\nI'll focus on isolating that 4x6 block to clarify how elements relate to one another and refine my understanding further.**Examining grid pattern symmetry**\n\nAt block row 3, columns 5-7 contain 3s, which may influence the transformation. The nearby TL seed is located at (4,1) with a value of 3. As I sketch the subblock, I identify specific values that help form a recognizable shape in a 6x7 grid. \n\nThis opens up a notion of 180-degree rotational symmetry, as rows reflect one another. It looks like I can define an algorithm based on these seeds to create a color-coded pattern that follows the established symmetry. These patterns seem to emphasize arc formations around seed values, suggesting a circle shape defined by quadrants with a consistent color assignment.",
