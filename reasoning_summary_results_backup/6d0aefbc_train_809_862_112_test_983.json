    "reasoning": "**Verifying grid transformation**\n\nI see the input grid has 5 rows and 3 columns: \"333,\" \"223,\" \"333,\" \"333,\" and \"332.\" I realize I need to create an output grid with 6 columns by concatenating each row with its reverse. For example, the first row \"333\" remains \"333,\" so concatenating gives \"333333.\" The second row \"223\" reversed is \"322,\" resulting in \"223322.\" Following this pattern, I confirm the final output:  \n\n```\n333333\n223322\n333333\n333333\n332233\n```  \n\nEverything looks good!",
