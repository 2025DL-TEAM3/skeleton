In the example, there\u2019s a unique number that stands out in each row, and I\u2019m trying to make sense of how they are selected. \n\nIn the second input of a 7x7 grid, it\u2019s interesting to see how the original numbers convert into a string-like output. For example, it shows transformations where the center number 7 is preserved, but other values shift around based on positions. It\u2019s like piecing together a puzzle!**Evaluating row patterns**\n\nI'm examining the input values for each row to determine the output. For Row 2, the output is all 3s since that\u2019s the unique non-7. Row 3 has unique values 2 and 1, with the least frequent being 1, leading to an output of all 1s. Row 4's output is all 3s as well. Row 5 has just one 2 at the end, but I'm seeing a repeated output pattern. The central column seems important, maintaining consistency across rows that have unique or repetitive values. I find this intriguing!**Deducing patterns in row outputs**\n\nI'm diving into how different rows behave with their unique and minority values. For instance, Row 5 has a tie with 3, and Row 3 has a unique 2, which should output uniformly, but it doesn't align; that\u2019s intriguing! It seems like rows with a majority of 6 trigger a certain pattern, while others follow a different rule with unique minorities. In general, when the minority value is 2, it seems to lean toward a specific pattern, while other minorities yield a uniform output. So, I\u2019m piecing together this puzzle!",
