    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid mapping rules**\n\nI'm working on an ARC task where I need to discover the rule mapping input grids of numbers to output grids. In the first set, the inputs consist of the digits '1' and '6', while the outputs use '2' and '5'. It seems that '1' maps to '5' and '6' to '2' quite consistently across examples. This appears to hold true, as I confirm that each corresponding input consistently translates according to this mapping.**Exploring digit mappings**\n\nI'm examining how to map input numbers to outputs in a given task. Initially, I observe the sequences and notice that an interesting pattern emerges. Transformations seem to reverse the first few inputs while keeping the last one consistent. I wonder if the mapping is influenced by specific numeric relationships or differences from certain values. \n\nI consider if there's a linear function governing this mapping, but it turns out too complex. It could be a context-specific mapping based on clusters, which I probably need to derive from training examples. Each puzzle might require its unique mapping based on the input digit set.**Understanding digit mapping rules**\n\nI'm examining input digits, specifically '4' and '9', to apply a mapping similar to a previous example. It appears the mapping converts larger digits to smaller output digits and vice versa. \n\nIn different instances, I consider if this pattern holds by reversing the sorted sequences. However, the mappings don't align as neatly as I hoped. It seems the recoloring of digits based on their frequency might be the key rule here. The goal is likely to replace each digit with others ranked by how often they appear. That gives a comprehensive recoloring based on frequency descending.**Decoding color mapping**\n\nI'm looking into a puzzle involving color mapping based on input digits. It seems the output values consistently reflect mappings where smaller input colors are transformed into brighter ones, while majority colors convert to darker shades. I've counted occurrences to identify the majority and minority colors accurately. \n\nIn my tests, it appears the rule is to replace the minority color with a bright value and the majority with a dark one, preserving the original structure. So, I will apply this mapping to create the output grid.",
