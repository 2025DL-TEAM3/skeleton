    "reasoning": "**Analyzing shape movement**\n\nI'm thinking about a shape with two 4's in the second row and how it might rotate. The shape moves down three rows while maintaining its column alignment, with color consistent as a 4. In the provided example with dimensions of 10 rows and 9 columns, I notice some anomalies in the fifth through ninth rows. Each row needs careful examination since there are deviations related to the positioning of the numbers, particularly with the repetition of certain placements of 2's and 4's.**Mapping shapes and movement**\n\nI'm analyzing the arrangement of shapes across multiple rows. The 3x3 block of 4's spans rows 3 to 5, while the shape of 3's occupies rows 8 and 9, with a 3 appearing in row 10. It seems like the 3-block is moved up into row 6, transforming the output while keeping the original locations of the 4-block intact. There seems to be a pattern where blocks swap positions or colors when they are adjacent. This needs careful mapping to understand the movement.**Understanding shape positioning**\n\nI'm analyzing how two blocks interact in this puzzle. The smaller block is positioned next to a larger block, trying to minimize the distance between them. For instance, the smaller 2-block starts in rows 7 and 8, and moves to columns 6 and 7, which makes it touch the large 4-block in column 7 without interfering in rows. Similarly, in another example, a small shape moves up to be adjacent to a larger shape by minimizing their distance. It's all about ensuring that shapes connect correctly and efficiently!",
