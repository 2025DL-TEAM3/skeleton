    "reasoning": "**Analyzing puzzle transformation**\n\nI see that this is a puzzle involving a grid of digits where each input digit is transformed into a larger output block. The first example shows an input of two rows and five columns, leading to an output that doubles the rows and columns. Each digit in the input becomes a 2x2 block in the output. For instance, an input digit of '0' results in '00 00' in its corresponding output block. I need to verify if this pattern holds for all digits.**Examining output transformations**\n\nThe output represented is structured in a way where each input digit doubles into a 2x2 block. For example, the digits '0', '9', '8', and '2' from the input grid align consistently in the output. Each digit from the input forms a corresponding block in the output, effectively doubling the dimensions while maintaining positions. Then, with each new example, I notice that similar rules apply, though some digits in the new outputs differ. I need to confirm if there's a variation in digit transformation occurring.**Confirming output structure**\n\nI see a consistent transformation happening: each input row produces two output rows, and each cell is turned into a 2x2 block. For instance, input row \"98040\" yields \"9988004400\" for rows 4-5, where '9' becomes '99', and so on. I need to verify the exact output matches my understanding of the duplication process, as each digit effectively scales by a factor of 2, leading to a clear and straightforward structure. Finally, the correct output should just feature the grid without any extra information, confirming there's no nuance to add.",
