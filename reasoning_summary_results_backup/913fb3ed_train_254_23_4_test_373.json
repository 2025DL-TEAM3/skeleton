    "reasoning": "**Analyzing distance calculations**\n\nI\u2019m determining positions within a distance of 2 from (0,1). For example, I find coordinates like (0,0) and (0,2) at a distance of 1, but then there's confusion about (0,3) at distance 2. While it should yield a value of 4 from the associated region, it appears to return 5 instead. This makes me wonder if only direct neighbors are considered. Plus, (1,0) also shows 4; could the grid\u2019s background affect this? I might need to explore a different distance method.**Investigating distance calculations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the distance from (1,0) to find why it equals 4. It seems like I misinterpreted the radial distance. Perhaps the shape defined is a diamond of radius 2? Yet, it skips some spots. I check the output and see that only specific coordinates near 8 receive a 4. There are likely vertical and horizontal limits, suggesting that only certain distances get filled. Hmm, is this related to Chebyshev distance? It seems like a 3x3 block is formed around 8, which might explain the filled regions.**Defining border rules**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out rules for drawing borders around non-background pixels. For any pixel with color not equal to the main background, I need to draw a Chebyshev square. I\u2019ve decided to use a function based on parity: if a pixel is even, I halve it for neighbors; if odd, I double it. This seems consistent with previous examples. \n\nIn my test grid, the background is 5, and the special pixel is 2. Therefore, I\u2019ll only change the pixel at (1,0) to 1, keeping everything else as the background value.**Determining border rules**\n\nI'm thinking about how to treat colors independently when replacing borders. It seems simpler to apply a rule based on parity. Each color's border should reflect the distance from the background. For the given test cases, I believe the Chebyshev distance for a radius of 1 should generally apply. \n\nIn my example, with a grid of 3 rows and 1 column, the special pixel's distance means only the neighboring row will change. Since rows 0 and 1 are affected, the output becomes:\n\n2\n1\n5\n\nI\u2019m ensuring the final answer is well formatted!",
    "test_output_text": "2\n1\n5\n",
    "correct": true
