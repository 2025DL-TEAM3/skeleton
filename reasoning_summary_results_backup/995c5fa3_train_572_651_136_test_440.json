It seems like they create a border and an inner frame. The inner region, where the 4 2s are located, connects around the border, excluding certain 7 positions. The central 2s at (2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(3,3) are surrounded by 7s at (2,1),(2,4),(3,1),(3,4), making it an interesting pattern of connectivity and adjacency.**Examining patterns in regions**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing if the border 2s and central 2s connect, which makes one region of 2s surrounded by 4 isolated 7s\u2014so that brings the total shapes to 5. I\u2019m unsure about counting the shapes, but it might be about thickness or quadrants. In the second example, I see a pattern forming: it lays out in a 4x4 grid with specific positions for 3s and 2s. The interior 2x2 segment is consistent with the earlier analysis, defining the overall structure.**Evaluating color patterns**\n\nI'm digging into whether the blocks create specific patterns. The top-left 4x4 forms a training pattern, but colors are swapped for borders and interiors. Then there\u2019s a rectangle of 1s. It seems like the solution might involve counting distinct colors in the pattern. Case1 had colors 2 and 7, but it outputs 3, while case2 reveals a 2x2 grid that outputs \"88\" and \"22.\" I wonder if the patterns map colors to new values or if there\u2019s another underlying logic, like counting adjacent shapes.**Analyzing output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m examining the output structure where the first row seems mapped to a color level. It looks like the top row is filled with 8s, while the bottom is filled with 7s. The numbers could represent counts of blocks or some mapping of colors. In case2, the expected output is \"22\" for the bottom row, but I\u2019m getting \"88\" and \"22.\" It raises questions about mapping between colors and numbers. I\u2019m leaning toward reporting the distinct colors from the interior blocks, leading me to propose the output as:\n\n88  \n77",
