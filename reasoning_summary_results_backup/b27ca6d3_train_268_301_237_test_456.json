    "reasoning": "**Analyzing row transformations**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the rows of numbers and their transformations. For instance, the first row shows an input of 5, 8, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 5, which changes the second position from 8 to 3 in the output. So the output becomes 5, 3, 8, 8, 5, 8, 8, 5, which I\u2019ll note as an important transformation.\n\nThe second row shows an input of all 8s but also results in a change, which is interesting! Let\u2019s keep examining these patterns.**Examining coordinate changes**\n\nI'm analyzing how certain coordinates change among the rows. For example, in the first row, the coordinate (1,2) changes to 3 due to the neighbor (1,1) being 5. Meanwhile, at (2,1) the 5 remains unchanged, which indicates that only nearby values surrounding 5 might change. Looking at (1,5) and its neighbors, they stay as 8, meaning there's no adjustment there.\n\nAt (6,7), coordinates shift around a cluster of 5s, creating an interesting transformation pattern with 3s emerging in a cross shape. It's intriguing to see how these values interact!**Calculating color clusters**\n\nI'm filling the border of a specific cluster with a new color, 3, while the majority of cells remain as 4. I identify border positions by looking at neighboring cells, excluding those within the cluster. After processing the neighbors of (1,1) and (1,2), I establish the union of border cells. \n\nI ensure that any positions determined as borders are updated to 3 in my output grid while the rest stay put, leading to my final rows. I double-check formats and confirm the output is accurate and consistent across examples provided.",
