    "reasoning": "**Analyzing row modifications**\n\nI need to clarify the output transformation of certain rows, particularly focusing on how 8 changes to 5 in specific contexts. For example, in Row 1, the input of 808 produces an output of 805 due to the changes around non-8 entries. Similarly, Row 8 transforms from 688 to 656. It seems that rows with non-8 entries attract modifications of surrounding 8s, but some changes are still puzzling, like why an 8 changes to a 6 instead of a 5.**Examining the color pattern**\n\nI'm identifying how colors transform within rows that contain the number 8, which is considered rare. It seems like for rows that include 8, original 8s are preserved while non-8 positions get filled with an alternating pattern, possibly involving 5 and another color. In example 1, Row 1 inputs 8,0,8, leading to the output of 8,0,5, which suggests a non-alternating pattern. Likewise, Row 8 changes from 6,8,8 to 6,5,6, indicating shifts in the coloring method when encountering non-background colors. I need to clarify these patterns further.**Confirming the output grid**\n\nI\u2019m working through how to fill values in a grid based on colors, establishing that the non-background color (minority) will dictate the pattern. Rows without non-background values stay unchanged. For instance, in Row 1 with input 8888788 that turns into 8888757, I\u2019ve confirmed that the pattern alternates between 5 and 7 after the first non-background color appears. I verified each row and every transformation, ensuring consistency. The final output confirms correctness across all rows.",
