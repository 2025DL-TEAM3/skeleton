    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC Puzzle**\n\nI'm diving into this ARC puzzle, specifically the examples that feature moving blocks. The first example has grids of digits that mostly look the same, except some positions have changed. I'm checking one row closely: the input '2222521122' turns into '2222511222'. It seems like the sequence '2,1,1,2' shifted to '1,1,2,2'. The single '2' after the 5 must have moved to the end of the run of '2's. Now, I'll analyze the next row and see how it differs!**Investigating Row Patterns**\n\nI'm noticing the changes in the rows of the examples. For example, in row 9, the input '2222221122' turned into '2222211122', showing an increase in the number of 1s from two to three. It appears that these blocks are shifting and changing as I go down the rows. In Example 2, the input '3333303333' shows a zero that seems to disappear in the output, possibly moved down. I\u2019m really curious how these patterns work together!**Understanding Color Movement**\n\nIn reviewing row 9, I noticed the output '2222211222' has three 1s, which raises questions about how those clusters are shifting. It seems that clusters, like the zeros in Example 2, move down a row but remain in their pattern. The zeros appear to mirror those in the input but shift down, while maintaining their positions in relation to other rows. \n\nThis implies a rule where pixels of a specific color move down a row, while other colors remain unchanged, and output rows receive colors from the previous rows. I\u2019ll need to keep exploring which color is active in Example 1!**Finalizing Output Verification**\n\nI'm double-checking row 3, going from '999999999' to '966999999,' and it looks correct. The background color is indeed 9, and it seems shape6 has been appropriately replaced. I need to verify adjacency too; shape6 covers specific coordinates, and shape7 overlaps in column 3. The rows seem correctly adjacent as well. The final output grid aligns nicely, confirming my observations. \n\nSo I feel confident in presenting the completed output!",
