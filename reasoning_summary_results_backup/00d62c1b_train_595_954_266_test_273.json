    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid transformation**\n\nI'm looking at a grid transformation where certain digits map to others, particularly in the interior while borders stay unchanged. For the first example, the grid is 8 rows by 6 columns. \n\nWhen I observe the transformation, the number 9 in the interior has changed to 4, but some 1s remain unchanged. For instance, in the second row, the input digits 9s become 4s in the output, while the input 1 stays the same. I see the same pattern in the following rows.**Examining grid transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing the transformation from one grid to another. For line 5, the input \"1 9 1 9 9 1\" changes to \"1 4 1 4 4 1,\" while line 6 mirrors line 2. In line 7, the 9 at the start remains unchanged, suggesting they modify certain 9s to 4 based on a defined shape. For the second example, the input grid is 9 rows by 6 columns, and rows 3 through 8 experience partial changes, with 9s in those rows mapped to 4s while maintaining 7s.**Exploring grid transformations and loops**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a grid transformation where specific regions are modified based on loop shapes created by certain numbers. In the earlier examples, rows 2-6 and columns 2-5 are filled with 4s, preserving original numbers where relevant. For the second example, I see that 7s create a loop enclosing surrounding numbers. I want to locate this closed loop to identify the interior area, which is then filled with 4s, overriding some numbers. It's crucial to see this pattern and definition in the next grid example too.**Finalizing the grid transformation**\n\nI\u2019m finalizing the new rows for the grid: \n\nRow 3 is \"3333433,\" Row 4 is \"2333443,\" and Row 5 changes to \"3334332,\" with the fourth column modified. \n\nI\u2019ve traced the positions in previous rows and confirmed the changes. The final grid layout looks like this:\n\n```\n3333232\n3333332\n3333433\n2333443\n3334332\n3333223\n```\n\nI also considered filling other interior clusters but found that many touch the borders, so they\u2019re not fully enclosed. It seems I\u2019m on the right track!",
