    "reasoning": "**Mapping input to output**\n\nI'm working on an ARC puzzle where I need to map input grids to their corresponding outputs. I have some training examples to guide me. The first example shows a grid with the dimensions of 7 rows and 6 columns filled mostly with the digit 6, along with some 1s, 2s, and 3s in certain spots. The rule seems to involve surrounding colors being replaced with a specific pattern. I'll analyze the additional examples for more clarity on the output dimensions.**Analyzing example 1**\n\nI'm looking at example 1, where the input consists of a 7x6 grid filled mostly with the number 6, mixed with a few 1s, 2s, and 3s. The output should also be a 7x6 grid. I notice that the 1s in the input form a plus shape, while the 3s appear in specific positions. The outputs for rows 4 and 5 show all 3s, and the last two output rows have mostly 6s but include a 2 in the last column. There seems to be some inconsistency with how the 2 is represented.**Examining example 3**\n\nI'm analyzing example 3, which consists of a 6x6 grid. The input contains mostly 6s, with some 1s, 2s, and 3s scattered throughout. Notably, the positions of the 1s form a pattern in specific rows. The output shows uniformity in rows for color 1, and rows 2 to 4 feature stripes filled with 2, despite the original input only having 2s in certain locations. This appears to follow a horizontal projection rule, while the behavior for color 3 seems to fill the entire row. I'm realizing that disconnected pixel forms may influence how projections are applied here.",
