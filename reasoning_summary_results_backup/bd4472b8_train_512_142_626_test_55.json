    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC mapping**\n\nI'm looking at this ARC problem with sequences of numbers and their outputs. We have three training tasks to analyze. The inputs are: 5714, 6666, and several instances of 8888. The mappings show that the first two inputs correspond directly to their outputs. However, the output for the repeated 8888s seems to be replaced sequentially. It\u2019s interesting to see how the same input can result in different outputs based on its position. Let's clarify this further as I continue my analysis!**Exploring digit mappings**\n\nI'm examining how certain digits transform based on given rules. For inputs like 827 and 821, the mapping changes 8 to 4, while others remain unchanged. Next, for 152 transforming to 252, it looks like 1 switches to 2, while 5 and 2 stay the same. There\u2019s a possible pattern where eight instances of 8 could cycle through various outputs like [4, 3, 1, 9, 2, 7]. It\u2019s intriguing to see how the mapping handles these repetitions, showing some digits consistently stay the same.**Understanding grid transformations**\n\nI'm realizing this task is about grid transformation instead of just numeric mapping\u2014these sequences represent patterns of colored cells. The digits serve as shorthand for colors. In the first training example, unique rows like 5714 and 6666 remain unchanged, while repeated rows of 8 transform into a vertical color pattern based on the unique rows. \n\nIt looks like the sequences of rows fill in with colors from the unique rows sequentially. For the second training, the consistent prefix with varied endings gives a pattern to explore. Each sequence holds a 7-length block of 8s, followed by an additional digit. This means the output will relate to the pattern established in the previous rows.**Following grid transformation logic**\n\nIt seems that row 1 and row 2 remain unchanged, while the output grid pattern is constructed by replacing row 3 with the pattern from row 1. The training example suggests skipping the uniform row (row 2) and repeating the first row's pattern, which results in:\n\n185743  \n666666  \n185743  \n\nThis aligns with the logic demonstrated in the training. I recognize that the filling of row 3 is based on the first row's pattern, confirming the output structure correctly.",
