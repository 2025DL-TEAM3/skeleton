    "reasoning": "**Exploring 2D grid transformations**\n\nI see we have ARC tasks involving transformations of 2D grids represented as strings of digits. There are three examples showcasing how input translates to output.\n\nIt looks like the transformation involves altering certain cells, possibly to create a border effect. I\u2019ll need to analyze the provided examples closely. The specific changes in selected cells hint at an underlying pattern or rule that dictates how the digits modify during the transformation process. Let's dive deeper into understanding that pattern!**Analyzing input example 2**\n\nI'm focusing on the second example where the grid consists mainly of 9s, with some 7s and 4s. The symmetry is interesting, especially with the central 4x4 area of 7s and 4s.\n\nThe output clearly modifies the borders by changing the rows containing 9s to include 4s, indicating a pattern where the 4s shifted outward. As a result, the rows seem to rotate the minority color, replicating elements to the edges. I need to explore how this transformation applies to other examples, especially regarding identifying the minority color in Example 1.",
