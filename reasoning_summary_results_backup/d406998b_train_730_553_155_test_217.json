It seems like the rules for changing symbols depend on whether the widths are even or odd. For instance, in examples with odd widths like 5 and 9, I change symbols in odd-indexed columns, but in an even-width example, I do the opposite. Given a grid of seven rows and three columns, since the width is odd, I'll focus on changing symbols in the odd columns. Now, I need to analyze which digits are in the grid to determine the minority symbol.**Counting occurrences**\n\nI'm counting the occurrences of digits '5' and '6' in the grid. It seems '5' appears a total of 15 times while '6' shows up only 6 times. Therefore, '6' is the minority. Given the grid\u2019s width of 3, which is odd, I\u2019ll change any '6's in columns 1 and 3 to '3'. I\u2019ll go through each row, applying this change, and then format the output as lines of digits without spaces. The final grid looks correct, so I\u2019ll present it!",
