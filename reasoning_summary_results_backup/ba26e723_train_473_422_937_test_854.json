    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the alignment**\n\nI'm looking at how the rows have changed, particularly the first numbers in each row. It seems I've increased the first digit of most rows to 6 while keeping others like Row 2 unchanged. Most likely, I'm aiming to create symmetry or a pattern here. I notice that some rows have become entirely new sequences, while others stay consistent. It\u2019s interesting to think about what the significance behind this shift could be! What am I trying to achieve with these changes?**Identifying column changes**\n\nI'm breaking down how columns swap positions in a six-digit configuration. It seems columns 1 and 4 are consistently the ones that change for widths of 4 or greater. For width 6, they switched positions 1 and 4, while in width 5 it\u2019s the same. However, this pattern isn't quite clear for widths less than 4. It\u2019s interesting to notice that the rule breaks down a bit, but I think I\u2019ve arrived at a generalization! The puzzle with an 8-column width might follow this too, focusing on columns 1 and 4 for changes.**Processing digit changes**\n\nI'm focusing on how to adjust specific columns based on the given rows of digits. For column 1, if the input digit isn't zero, it should become '6'; otherwise, it stays '0'. Column 4 follows the same rule. Other columns remain unchanged. As I evaluate each row, I confirmed that this pattern holds consistently\u2014col1 and col4 are the only ones modified across various widths. After double-checking, I finalized the output grid without any errors. Here\u2019s the result:\n\n05065209  \n02800038  \n07068497  \n68007950  \n04000300  \n00000103",
