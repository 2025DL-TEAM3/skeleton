So I check each output row, like Row2 equating to [1,1,1,1,1,1] and Row3 to [8,7,1,1,8,5]. That seems inconsistent with a simple transpose of the input. For example, while Row1 starts correctly, its second part outputs a zero rather than matching the input column. So, it's not a straightforward transpose after all!**Examining column transformations**\n\nIt seems like there's a transformation happening between the input columns and the output rows, but it\u2019s not just a simple reversal. For example, the first output row matches the input column in some instances but deviates in others, like where the second input column value outputs as zero. When I compare those values, there\u2019s a pattern where output rows correspond to input columns but in reverse order, possibly with some adjustments. Let\u2019s verify this with more examples to confirm the transformation method used!**Validating output format**\n\nI've got the final output, which consists of eight rows with no spaces: \n\n331  \n453  \n379  \n323  \n333  \n108  \n333  \n086  \n\nSo, it\u2019s all laid out correctly in a grid format.
