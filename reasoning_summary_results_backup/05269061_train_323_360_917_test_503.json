    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input rows**\n\nI'm inspecting a series of input rows labeled from 0 to 9. The pattern seems to form a repeating cycle every five rows in the output, where the unique outputs appear first, then they start to repeat. I notice there's a diagonal alignment of 7s in the input and a sequence of numbers leading to a 9, 2, 5, 9, 0 in the lower rows. It\u2019s intriguing to see how these numbers connect and create these patterns!**Exploring patterns in grids**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a 5x5 torus pattern that's repeated in a 2x2 block format. The idea is that two diagonal numbers can create a sequence, hinting at snake or cycle shapes for filling the grid. For instance, with given values defining \u201cseed\u201d points in a 4x4 grid, I see it can create a checkerboard pattern of alternating numbers. It\u2019s interesting that some digits, like 0, are excluded from the output, likely to keep the focus on non-zero values. I think the overall rule is to derive the filling pattern from these significant cells.**Analyzing grid patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at how a 5x5 pattern creates a tiled output with periodicity in both dimensions. It seems the output fills the grid by inferring the tile based on specific non-zero input points, leading to a repeating sequence. I also notice that new rows are generated by cyclically shifting the previous row. For example, this results in a checkerboard pattern in some examples. The base sequence is crucial since it dictates how the grid will fill, which is exciting to uncover!",
