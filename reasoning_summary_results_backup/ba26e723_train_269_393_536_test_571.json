It seems like I might need to change specific digits to 6 depending on their position\u2014specifically, if they\u2019re endpoints. The task might involve examining a central pattern surrounded by zeros in each row, with the zeros indicating a white background while colored numbers suggest diagonal patterns. I\u2019m trying to clarify if only some of the non-zero digits should be modified based on these rules.**Analyzing digit replacement rules**\n\nI'm exploring a rule regarding filling in missing 6's based on the presence of certain digits without neighboring matches in specific directions. For example, in one dataset, only certain columns change, specifically columns 1 and 4. It seems that patterns emerge\u2014like changing every third column (1, 4, 7, 10) aligns with a stride of 3. Importantly, non-zero digits are replaced with 6, while zeros remain unchanged. I have to confirm this consistency across different examples, and it looks like I\u2019m on the right track.**Applying column rules**\n\nI'm analyzing how to modify a grid based on column patterns, particularly where the column index matches a specific condition. For columns where (c-1)%3==0, any non-zero digits should change to 6, while zeros are left unchanged. As I process the grid row by row, I\u2019m confirming this applies consistently across examples, resulting in specific transformations as I go. After checking my outputs for accuracy, I find they align with the rules established.
