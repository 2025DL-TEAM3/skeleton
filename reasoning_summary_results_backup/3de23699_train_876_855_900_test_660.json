    "reasoning": "**Analyzing a grid layout**\n\nI'm examining a grid where the top-left 6x6 has specific frames and the lower rows are filled with 5s. I think the output has 4 rows and 3 columns. The rows seem to correspond to the quadrants, and the mappings of 4s are particularly interesting since they align with the corners of the initial grid. It looks like the output might be focusing on the perimeter of a shape derived from the layout of the grid.**Exploring grid outputs**\n\nI'm analyzing a 6x6 grid for patterns, particularly focusing on blocks of 2x2 to determine values. When I trace 4s in the grid, it seems we're averaging or determining modes for blocks, but some outputs don't match my expectations. For example, the mode in one block yields 5, but the output is 4. I wonder if it's choosing the minimum value instead. Also, I realize the bottom rows are all 5s, so I'm considering how to represent those effectively in the output.**Evaluating bounding boxes**\n\nI'm looking at a grid to determine its output dimensions and bounding box. It seems the output width is 5, consistent with certain examples, but it\u2019s different from the earlier outputs. I suspect I\u2019ve miscalculated some blocks. \n\nI'm finding the bounding box for specific values, and by excluding the borders, I establish a subgrid that corresponds to the output. The values transform based on their surrounding color, so it\u2019s a matter of identifying the right color boundaries. The interior noise gets swapped out appropriately based on the rules I\u2019m figuring out.**Analyzing shape and colors**\n\nI\u2019m mapping out the positions of colors in a grid, where 1s represent the shape color, 0s are interior noise, and 3 is the background. The bounding box around the shape gives it a height and width of 5, leading to a 3x3 interior subgrid when borders are removed.\n\nI\u2019m transforming any 0s into 1s, leaving the background as is. This leads me to the final output of 131, 313, and 133, keeping consistent with earlier examples and avoiding adjacency fills that weren\u2019t applied before.",
