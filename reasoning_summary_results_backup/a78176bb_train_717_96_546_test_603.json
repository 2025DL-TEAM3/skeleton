    "reasoning": "**Analyzing patterns in rows**\n\nI\u2019m examining row 7, specifically \"0000070007,\" and I see it has values in both column 5 and column 9, both being 7. For the index rows, I've listed each row with its corresponding column indicators. \n\nIt's interesting to note how the left marker sequence positions the numbers across the rows, but row 0\u2019s column 3 stands out as an outlier. I need to keep track of these patterns as they certainly influence the overall sequence!**Examining marker positions**\n\nI'm analyzing how the left marker moves with its specific pattern through the grid: 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. This sequence cycles smoothly through the columns. The right marker positions show a similar pattern: starting from row 0 at column 9 down to row 6 at column 9. So, the head of this pattern is at (0, 3) while the tail is at (6, 9). \n\nI need to be mindful of the output rows in relation to these movements, ensuring they correctly display the head and tail positions. I\u2019ll also look at potential circular shifts for other examples to confirm this concept!**Mapping the snake's path**\n\nI'm examining how colors in the output grid indicate different parts of the snake's path. The output shows colors like 0 and 3\u2014likely designating tail and head segments. However, examples vary, and I see a pattern emerging.\n\nIn the second example, it seems the head might be represented by 8, while the body could be indicated by 3. I need to carefully track these variables as they help me reconstruct the overall path and the age of each segment as the snake moves across rows. \n\nUltimately, it clarifies how the snake occupies and travels through the grid, leaving behind colored segments that change over time.",
