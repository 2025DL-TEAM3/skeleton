    "reasoning": "**Considering seed patterns**\n\nI'm thinking about how the seeds along the left boundary and those in the corners could create endpoints for segments to fill stripes. It seems the seeds might define two points on the boundary, and I could fill the shortest path between them. For Example 1, the seeds at (0,0) and (4,0) might draw an X shape to opposite boundaries. My idea is to find the color that appears the least, perhaps 1 or 2 times, and draw diagonals across the grid. Example 2 has four seeds positioned at the corners.**Exploring diagonal patterns**\n\nI'm considering how the endpoints of two diagonals connect from (0,0) to (6,2), despite the challenge of connecting them. An alternative idea is to draw a zigzag diagonal pattern from each seed color on the boundary into the grid. Looking at Example 2, I can see an alternating pattern in the rows. It seems that the colors may form a checkerboard pattern based on the sum of the row and column indices. While testing with Example 1, there's a mismatch with color placements, but seeds at (0,0) and (4,0) create an X shape along one edge.**Analyzing seed patterns**\n\nI'm realizing there are more seeds per row than I anticipated, which changes everything. A better approach might be to identify the symmetry axis of the grid and create a diamond or X shape based on that color. I could draw patterns from non-background cells depending on their placement. For Example 1, it seems the diagonals should form an X shape with endpoints at the seed locations. Yet, I noticed inconsistencies with the provided outputs and need to confirm if the count of seeds is accurate in Example 3.",
