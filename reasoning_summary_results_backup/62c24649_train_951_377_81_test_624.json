For instance, the row \"5732662375\" is indeed symmetric when reversed, confirming it's a palindrome.\n\nNow, to create the mirrored grid, I\u2019ll first mirror horizontally, doubling the width. After that, I\u2019ll mirror it vertically to double the height. For example, a 3x2 input grid turns into a 6x4 output after these transformations. The test input shows how we can expand \u201c79\u201d, \u201c99\u201d, and \u201c79\u201d accordingly.**Constructing the mirrored grid**\n\nI\u2019m expanding each row by mirroring them vertically. For example, the first row \u201c79\u201d becomes \u201c7997\u201d when I reverse it. The same happens with the second row \u201c99\u201d; it stays the same while expanding to \u201c9999.\u201d \n\nThen, I create the bottom half of the grid by mirroring the top half. This produces a complete grid of six rows:  \n\n7997  \n9999  \n7997  \n7997  \n9999  \n7997  \n\nThe output format is simple\u2014just the lines without quotes. That's the answer!",
