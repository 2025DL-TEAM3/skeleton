What if B[i] is a sum of neighbors instead? Testing showed some contradictions. Maybe B indicates transitions? I'm contemplating a mapping example with a 5x5 grid that rearranges rows based on specific transitions. It seems row outputs depend on which row they come from, highlighting dynamics in the structure. I'll keep this in mind for further analysis!**Exploring grid transformations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing input row indices and their mappings, which leads me to define a function that captures symmetric behavior in the rows. The middle row remains unchanged, while edges swap with others. I\u2019m considering a circular structure for the rows, where the top and bottom wrap around. Testing reveals outputs depend on surrounding rows, potentially suggesting a formula involving sums with diagonal directions. Essentially, I\u2019m trying to identify how to transform sequences from input to output in a more uniform manner.**Deciphering row transformations**\n\nI'm examining how to derive output sequences from input rows by identifying minimal repeating motifs and arranging them into palindromic forms. I consider factors like distinct non-zero clusters and their impacts on the results. It seems the transformation reflects non-zero rows around a central value while discarding zero rows. By adjusting the sequences accordingly, I believe I can replace ranks with values from surrounding rows. After testing various approaches, I think this might be the best attempt at defining the grid transformation process.",
