    "reasoning": "**Visualizing the shape of 8**\n\nI'm checking the shape of input1, which seems to resemble a big square with holes. It appears to be a frame formed by the number 8. The square's border starts from specific coordinates, like row 1, column 4 and continues through various rows. There's a complex pattern here, likely with a contiguous 8 region. After marking the 8's in the input, it seems there are two loops: an outer loop and an inner pattern of diagonals, suggesting two distinct shapes.**Simplifying neighbor mapping**\n\nI'm considering a simpler rule for mapping: for 7s, if they have exactly four 8 neighbors, they should map to 2. But I need to check if diagonal neighbors also count. For instance, in row 5, column 7, there are 2 diagonal 8s and 2 four-connected 8s, totaling 4 neighbors, which meets the threshold. \n\nI'll apply the same method to other rows, like row 4, column 3, which has 8 total neighbors. For row 3, column 1, it only has 2, so it won\u2019t qualify. I\u2019ll verify that the counting works for neighboring 8s consistently across other regions, like row 7, column 5, where it also holds true.",
