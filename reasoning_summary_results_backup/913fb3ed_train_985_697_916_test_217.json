I'm thinking they should all become 6, including the diagonals at (2,2) and (2,4). That gives me 5 positions total: (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), (3,2), and (3,4). It seems like we should mark these surrounding pixels with color 6, while keeping the original color for the special 3, and the background as 7.**Analyzing surrounding colors for expansion**\n\nThere's an '8' at (2,5), and I'm considering its eight neighboring positions. The neighbors are at (1,4), (1,5), (1,6), (2,4), and (2,6). It seems these positions should all turn into 4s because they surround the 8. \n\nI\u2019m determining the transformation rule: when a cell has a distinct value, its neighbors fill with a new color to create an outline effect. For this case, the 8's neighbors change from 9 (background) to 4. I'm examining the new color and its relationship to the interior. It's interesting to see how these transformations work!**Testing color transformation theory**\n\nI'm testing the theory with a new sample. For M=8, it's even, so dividing gives me 4. For M=3, I double it to 6. Now, for an input with M=2, I set the neighboring color to 1. \n\nThe grid based on the input shows a marker at (1,5) with eight neighbors. I identify positions: (1,4), (1,6), (2,4), (2,5), and (2,6) to fill with the new color 1. The output renders correctly as \"555121555\" for the first row and \"555111555\" for the second, confirming the theory!",
