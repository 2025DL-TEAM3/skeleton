    "reasoning": "**Examining row reversal in puzzles**\n\nIt looks like this puzzle involves reversing rows of input data. In the first example of seven rows, the output is simply the rows reversed in order, moving the bottom row to the top. The second example follows the same pattern. However, in the third example, it seems like more is happening than just a straightforward reversal\u2014specifically, the digits in the rows have changed. I need to take a closer look at these changes in the last example to fully understand what's going on.**Analyzing grid transformation**\n\nIn this example, I\u2019m looking at a 9x9 input grid and its output. The transformation from input to output seems like it involves reversing rows but keeping their order. For instance, when I reversed the last row of input, I got the first output row. Each input row flips horizontally, so input row two remains the same in output. I need to confirm whether all rows follow this horizontal reflection pattern rather than a full 180\u00b0 rotation. Checking against earlier examples shows some inconsistencies, which I need to clarify further.**Identifying symmetry in grids**\n\nI'm analyzing a 7x7 grid to identify uniform rows or columns for possible reflection. It looks like rows one to four show uniformity, but I need to find the unique color. The fourth row stands out since its unique color is six, while others are nines. This row serves as a central axis for vertical reflection. After reflecting rows around this axis, the new configuration appears consistent with examples of only vertical reflections. I have confirmed the output is accurate, reflecting rows correctly!",
