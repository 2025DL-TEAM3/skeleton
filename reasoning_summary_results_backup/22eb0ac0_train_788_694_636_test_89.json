    "reasoning": "**Inspecting grid patterns**\n\nI'm looking at numeric grids where each row has all digits as strings. In the examples, it seems there's a consistent pattern to change certain cells, particularly in the interior rows. For example, the first row and last row stay unchanged while the middle rows modify certain columns. \n\nI notice the second column changes from 2 to 9, while others match the first row's values. This suggests a specific manipulation based on the border. There\u2019s definitely an interesting transformation happening here!**Analyzing row transformations**\n\nI noticed that the first row is 1 9 0 7 8 1 8, and it looks like the second row's columns 2 to 7 were replaced with values from the first and last rows. The second row ends up being 2 9 2 7 8 1 8. \n\nWhat\u2019s interesting is how columns 2, 4, 5, 6, and 7 have values that match row1, while column 3 doesn\u2019t. It seems a pattern emerges where values are filled based on the comparison of row1 and row10 \u2014 where they match, the output reflects those values, and for differing columns, it retains the original column value. It's a clever process of transformation!**Understanding grid fill rules**\n\nI'm examining a grid fill rule. If the top and bottom cells of a column match, the interior cells should be filled with that value. In the second example, even though the top and bottom rows are the same with all 8s, only the second row changed to all zeros, while the other rows remained the same. This is puzzling! \n\nI think the rule might apply differently based on specific patterns or shapes in columns. It looks like they extended the zeros between the existing boundaries rather than filling with 8s, creating an interesting pattern transformation!",
