The input structure has several rows with various numbers, and checking row 4, I see specific positions marked. Rows 5 and 6 have identifiable patterns too. \n\nThere seems to be symmetry in the input with 4s located in specific corners. These 4s might indicate the boundaries for a 4x4 grid, which could represent the area of interest once we ignore the borders.**Finding the enclosing rectangle**\n\nI'm thinking about how to identify the smallest rectangle that includes all non-background colors, then downsample that area. For example, with background=2 and non-background colors being 4 and 0, the bounding box for 4 includes positions (2,1), (2,6), (7,1), and (7,6). This region spans a 6x6 area, which I could shrink to 4x4 by dropping a boundary of 1 on each side.\n\nHowever, the values don't seem to match outputs. Maybe there\u2019s a transformation happening, where zeros inside are replaced with 4s. It seems that the input zeros became 4s, resulting in matching rows. I've double-checked the translations and now they look consistent.**Understanding the extraction rules**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to find the bounding box of non-background shape markers. In the examples provided, I've identified that zeros often represent holes to be filled, while the four corners made by other colors outline the shape. \n\nThe approach seems to involve locating these corners, determining the area to analyze, and filling zeros (or holes) with the border color. I\u2019m noticing that the pattern repeats across examples with slight variations, but the methodology remains consistent. I'll extract the established interior region and adjust the values accordingly to get the expected output.**Extracting and transforming the grid**\n\nI'm identifying how to extract the subgrid from the input matrix by finding the minimum and maximum rows and columns. The objective is to remove the border rows and columns to isolate the interior region, which consists of a background color and a fill color. I noticed that in the examples, the background color remains unchanged while we convert the hole color to the border color. \n\nFor the given input, the rows and columns confirmed my assumptions about the colors, leading to the correct output. So, I'll format that as rows of digits.",
