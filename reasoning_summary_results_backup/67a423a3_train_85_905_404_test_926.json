    "reasoning": "**Analyzing matrix changes**\n\nI'm noticing that the last row in the first example remains unchanged, which seems contradictory to the first and last rule. I should consider columns as well; perhaps only a specific submatrix in the center is modified. Moving to the second example, it seems columns 0-3 are altered while 4-8 are unchanged. In the third example, it looks like the submatrix changes again, this time affecting rows 1-4 and varying columns. I\u2019m piecing together how these changes are applied.**Examining matrix transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing how the changes are made in the matrix. For example, transforming 10111 to 44411 affects columns 0 and 2, while columns 1 and 3 remain the same. I see that input values influence which numbers change; only specific columns are modified based on their previous values. I suspect there's a cross-pattern in the changes, particularly for certain rows and columns, leading to a filled outer border with 4s while the interior remains zeros. This pattern seems intentional!**Developing the stripe algorithm**\n\nI'm working on an algorithm to find two perpendicular color stripes on a grid. The horizontal stripe will be defined by rows with uniform color and must be distinct from the surrounding colors, while the vertical stripe will consist of columns with a uniform color that don\u2019t overlap with rows that have been previously identified. I'll look for the most contiguous segments of uniform color in both dimensions. With some examples, I see it involves identifying how colors interact with each other to form these stripes. This could be quite complex, but I think I\u2019m getting the hang of it!",
