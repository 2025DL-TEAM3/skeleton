    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC-like puzzle**\n\nI'm looking at a puzzle where inputs are grids of digits, and the outputs are always 3x3. So, in each example, regardless of the dimensions, we end up with a smaller grid. The outputs are composed of only the digits 0 and 5, and it seems like I need to identify a rule that maps the input to output by summarizing a certain property. I wonder if it's about counting particular elements or something similar in the input grids. Let's explore this further!**Investigating grid patterns**\n\nI'm looking more closely at the digit grids and their outputs. In each example, the output grids, which are all 3x3, present a pattern where the digits are constrained to 0 and 5. I think I need to analyze how the input relates to these outputs. The inputs have various digits, but I might be counting occurrences in specific segments of the grid. It seems like a strategy could be to check for the presence of specific digits like 0 or 5 and then assign outputs based on that. Let's experiment further!**Reflecting on the grid transformation**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing these digit grids to deduce the underlying transformation rule. Each 3x3 output seems to represent a shape derived from the input, where certain digits align to form an object or color pattern. I think I need to focus on the presence of specific digits, like zeros, to determine their impact on the output. The blocks could be compared based on their frequency of digits, evaluating if they're above or below a threshold. I'm realizing this may be more about recognizing shapes and their representations rather than purely counting digits. It's quite intricate!**Mapping downsampled shapes**\n\nI'm working on compressing a shape from a larger grid into a 3x3 format. I think about segmenting my rows, considering options like [1, 2, 1] for the distribution of values. The predicted output translates values from segments into a final output following the pattern seen in previous examples, mapping shapes to 5 and backgrounds to 0.\n\nSo, for my test input, I'm predicting the output will be:\n\n```\n050\n500\n555\n```\n\nIt seems consistent with how shapes and backgrounds have been represented in the earlier examples!",
