    "reasoning": "**Analyzing an ARC puzzle**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC puzzle involving an 8x8 grid. The first example gives me a grid that's outlined with 2s, showing that the interior section is crucial. It seems I need to extract a 4x4 subgrid from the inner area. The pattern looks like I grab columns 3-6 and rows 3-6 from the big grid, but the output seems to be reversed. Hmm, maybe that\u2019s a 90-degree rotation at play. Let\u2019s dig deeper into the mechanics of this puzzle!**Exploring the interior grid logic**\n\nI\u2019m listing the interior grid rows, which go from 2 to 5. The values lead me to an inner grid where specific columns show zeros and a 5. This suggests the output replaces 2s with 0s and then maybe rotates or shifts the remaining values. The process seems to remove columns where all values are identical \u2014 keeping only the significant ones like the 5. In the end, the output reflects this transformation, showing a more simplified representation.**Deciphering the puzzle pattern**\n\nUpon revisiting the examples, it looks like I\u2019m focused on transforming the interior grid based on specific rules. For instance, in the output, I noticed how values like 2 and 0 could be treated as background elements and removed or replaced, while numbers like 5 maintain their significance. The method of rotation, flipping, or shifting left seems designed to fit shapes neatly within the grid. That's a critical point: the shape is adjusted to ensure it starts at the top-left, following the pattern given in the examples.",
