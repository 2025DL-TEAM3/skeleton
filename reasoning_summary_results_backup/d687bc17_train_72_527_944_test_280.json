    "reasoning": "**Analyzing the ARC Puzzle**\n\nI'm working on an ARC puzzle that involves some patterns with numbers and zeros in a grid layout. From the first example, I notice changes in the interior rows based on the presence of specific digits, particularly focusing on the center column. For example, in one row, a '4' is changed to '0' in the output, suggesting there's a modification rule that affects certain columns if specific conditions are met. I need to keep exploring these patterns!**Examining Row Changes**\n\nI\u2019m diving into the changes in row 4 of the puzzle. The input has specific digits, and in the output, I see that several values have changed to zero. The original number '9' is turned into '0', while '6' is retained or shifted. It seems that the transformation may involve moving digits to form a specific pattern, with particular focus on edge values like '7' and '8'. Observing the outer rows, they remain unchanged, suggesting they help define the boundaries. This is interesting!**Analyzing Output Patterns**\n\nI'm digging into the output for the second row, which is '022227'. Observing the interior rows reveals a pattern: specific digits are moving, while others disappear. For instance, a '7' shifts toward the border along with zeros in specific columns. In another example, the zero moved from one position to the rightmost column. It looks like numbers either move closer to the border or remain stationary based on their position relative to other digits. This examination of outputs helps clarify these transformative rules in the puzzle!",
