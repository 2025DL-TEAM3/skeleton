    "reasoning": "**Analyzing a 3x3 pattern**\n\nI\u2019m looking at the third example of the 3x3 grid. The input is a matrix of numbers that expands into a 6x6 output. I notice the first row of the output takes the numbers directly from the input. But then it seems to be taking vertical pieces from the input as well. It feels like it might be shifting parts of the grid to overlay them. I\u2019m trying to break down how this works, focusing on how the inputs are rearranged into the outputs.**Exploring the 6x6 output**\n\nI'm examining how the 3x3 input is transformed into a 6x6 output. For example, the first row of the output combines elements from row0 and column0 of the input. Similarly, for each output row, I see where the input rows and columns overlap, sometimes creating shifts or rotations in the values.\n\nIt looks like there's a consistent method of mapping\u2014first three entries come from rows, while the second part corresponds to the columns, but some are shifted.\n\nI'm piecing together how these patterns form within the 6x6 matrix.**Determining output configurations**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how to construct the output grid from the input values. It seems I've identified that the bottom-right quadrant should match a 180-degree rotation; however, the last row had mismatches. \n\nAfter recalculating, it turns out the output for the bottom rows aligns correctly with rotations. I see the pattern where each quadrant of the output is a specific rotation of the input grid.\n\nFor a simple input like a single number, the output grid is filled entirely with that number, confirming the pattern holds. The final result for the 2x2 grid of \"3\" is simply \"33\" on two lines.",
