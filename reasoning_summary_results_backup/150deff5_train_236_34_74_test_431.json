The cluster at (4,4) seems connected to (3,4) and expands to include (4,5), (4,6), and even to (5,6) and (6,5). \n\nHowever, (5,5) is a '6', which complicates things. Is (6,5) isolated? It only touches (5,6) diagonally, so it doesn\u2019t connect in the 4-direction, making it a separate component. My output indicates an inconsistency where row 6, column 5 shifts from '9' to '2'. Curious about that!**Exploring cluster replacements**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how certain clusters were replaced in the output. The cell that was originally '9' in column 6 was replaced with '2', changing that isolated single into a small cluster. There are other clusters too, like the 3-length horizontal one in row 8, which also turned into '2'.\n\nIn examining row 5, I see that positions (5,1), (5,2), and (5,3) were changed from '9' to '2', while some in a larger cluster turned into '8' based on their connections. The rule might involve filling holes or patterns in these clusters.**Identifying shape replacements**\n\nI\u2019m diving into how each colored shape is filled based on its size! For example, a horizontal 3x1 gets filled with color A, while a 2x2 square turns into color B. In the last few examples, I see clusters and how each cell is replaced.\n\nIn instance one, 1-cell clusters and horizontally aligned groups consistently got turned into '2', while 2x2 blocks were filled with '8'. However, in the third example, a horizontal shape sized 2 somehow got '8', which conflicts with the earlier rule. I need to clarify the handling of shape sizes!**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI\u2019m checking column values and mapping each covered block. For example, certain columns are filled based on their block groupings. The layout reveals that columns are either covered by blocks or set to specific values, like '2' or '8\u2019.\n\nFor row outputs, I confirm each digit\u2019s validity by ensuring the correct counts match. Everything seems good across the grid, and I've made sure every position is accounted for without missing blocks. Overall, it looks like I've produced a consistent output grid!",
