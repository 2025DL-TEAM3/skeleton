    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle structure**\n\nI'm trying to figure out this ARC puzzle involving small grids of numbers. The example I have shows a three-row input grid generating six output rows. So, I think each input cell represents a digit, and the outputs formatted into sequences correspond to some manipulation of these inputs. The first example shows a 6x6 output grid, and it seems there might be a pattern of repetition or transformation like flipping or tiling. I\u2019ll need to inspect this relationship further!**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the input grid, which is composed of three rows of numbers, and trying to understand how it generates a 6x6 output. It seems like I can consider a 2x2 tiling approach to modify the input. So, I need to break down the output by examining blocks. \n\nThe first block mirrors the input, while determining the structure of the following blocks reveals patterns of symmetry and concatenation. Ultimately, I\u2019m aiming to see how each row relates to the original rows while spotting any transformations or mirroring involved!**Calculating grid rotations**\n\nI\u2019m working with an input grid and trying to perform rotations to create a new output. For a clockwise (cw) rotation, the first row of the output corresponds to reversed columns of the input, and it\u2019s matching nicely. Next, I\u2019ll create a 6x6 grid by performing different rotations: cw, counterclockwise (ccw), and 180 degrees. \n\nAfter computing all rotations correctly and validating them, I\u2019ll collate the results to form the final output, resulting in six lines formatted for the user.
