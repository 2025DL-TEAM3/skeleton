    "reasoning": "**Filling symmetry in patterns**\n\nI'm exploring a potential rule for filling symmetry in a set of rows. If there's a mismatch in a non-pattern row, I should fill in the missing parts. I realize each pattern row should be symmetrical. For example, in a given input, I see alternating patterns with filler rows of zeros. I need to be careful about how I fill in these rows based on the example. It looks like some numbers need to change to maintain symmetry. I\u2019ll summarize my findings accordingly.**Understanding pattern transformation**\n\nSo, I'm analyzing some patterns where I'm noticing changes in positions. It seems odd positions in rows need to transition symmetrically. For instance, in certain rows, values change to align with the most common value, and they form a palindromic structure. \n\nIn the examples, it looks like the odd positions shift from a sequence of six down to four over time, creating a gradient effect. This transition appears linear, moving gradually from the constant value of 6 to 4, adjusting middle values for symmetry across rows.**Analyzing matrix propagation**\n\nI'm figuring out how patterns in a matrix are changed. For example, in certain rows, values from the endpoints are propagated inward. M1 had its second and third positions modified to be the same as the first, while M2 and M3 only changed one position based on the value from M4. \n\nIt seems the algorithm fills values from outer borders toward the center in a structured way. I need to formalize this process for a new matrix, ensuring I account for both even and odd dimensions correctly. Let\u2019s keep refining the approach!",
