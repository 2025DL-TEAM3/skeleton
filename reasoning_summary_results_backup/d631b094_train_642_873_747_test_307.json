With that, I conclude the output should be '55555', reflecting the total count without leading zeros.**Finalizing Output Formatting**\n\nIt looks like the output should be formatted as a grid, specifically as a line of digits. Given the total count of fives is five, the output will simply be \"55555.\" \n\nI need to ensure I'm providing it in the correct format as shown in the examples.
