For example, the first pair is 4344 and 3333, which seems to yield a result of 3333. I'm wondering if I'm comparing them element-wise and finding the minimum of corresponding columns. In the first example, I noticed the smallest element may be consistently taken, but then, for other pairs like 3334 and 3344, the output was unexpectedly 2223. This suggests there's more complexity in calculating the outputs than just taking the minimum.**Exploring output patterns**\n\nI'm thinking about counting or comparing digits in my outputs, especially since I notice mostly 2 or 3 digits appearing, while there are rows with digits greater than 3. When I look at row comparisons, like row3 and row4, I wonder if I'm counting unique values or occurrences. \n\nFor instance, in one case, there are two 3s resulting in an output of 2. However, for another column, it seems to suggest counting different things, leading to confusion about the expected outputs.
