Each example reveals a repeating pattern showcasing a \"plus\" shape with digits. The first two outputs show: \n\n5 5 5  \n0 5 0  \n0 5 0  \n\nThey form a grid shaped like a plus sign, indicating a consistent pattern across the examples. This insight might help me decipher the remaining examples more effectively!**Identifying Shapes in ARGrid**\n\nI\u2019m realizing that the output shapes from the ARGrid puzzle can resemble a \"T\" or a plus sign. The first two examples produce a downward-pointing T shape with 5s on top, while the third example looks like a plus sign. \n\nTo identify shapes, I need to assess the clusters of numbers in the input grids, recognize their orientation, and use this information to generate a consistent 3x3 representation. \n\nIt's clear that identifying the bounding box and orientation is key for this task!**Analyzing Non-2 Values in Grids**\n\nI'm examining the input grids for clusters of digits that aren't 2, focusing particularly on the numbers 5, 8, and 4. In my first example, I noticed an L-shaped arrangement formed by these digits at specific coordinates. I mapped their positions and visualized the output, which seems tied to detecting colors and shapes\u2014like a plus or T shape. \n\nIn the second example, there are more digits, but many are background 2s. I'm looking at how the arrangement of non-1 digits could help identify shapes in a consistent 3x3 output.",
