    "reasoning": "**Analyzing grid modifications**\n\nI\u2019ve got several examples showing how certain grid shapes are manipulated by modifying interior numbers. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the first example, which has a shape of 7x6, verifying that it indeed has 7 rows. The input is made up of seven lines. When comparing the input and output character by character, I can see specific changes occurring in particular positions across various rows, with some numbers being incremented. This illustrates a clear transformation.**Examining 8s in the grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how the 8s in this grid are shaped. The bottom row shows no change, but the pattern seems to indicate a sort of 'blob' of 8s forming a diamond or circle-like shape in the center. I\u2019m mapping their coordinates from the input grid; positions like (2,4), (3,5), and others create a diagonal effect. The output has 8s mostly retaining their places but expanding slightly. It looks like they extended leftwards until they hit a boundary, leading to an interesting pattern transformation.**Identifying filling rules in grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how numbers fill in these grids. For row 5, col 3 in the output is confirmed as 8, moving horizontally rather than vertically around anomalies. I need to assess example 3\u2019s grid: the anomaly of '4' amongst '9s' shows that, despite some consistent positioning, the filled sections model a pattern of continuity. The filling rules seem to depend on the distance between anomalies, affecting how they fill in each row selectively and leaving contiguous segments unchanged. This offers insights into the filling logic behind the transformations.",
