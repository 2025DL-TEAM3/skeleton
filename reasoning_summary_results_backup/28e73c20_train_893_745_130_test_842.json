    "reasoning": "**Mapping zero shapes**\n\nI'm analyzing the connectivity of preserved regions in a grid, focusing on specific coordinates. The preserved shape appears to form a continuous outline, suggesting a ring or an 'S' shape, possibly representing the digit '0' through connections of zeros. As I plot the zeros, they seem to create distinct patterns across various rows and columns. It\u2019s intriguing to consider whether these configurations visually represent something meaningful in the input grid. Let's keep exploring this shape!**Analyzing preserved regions**\n\nI'm looking at a grid where preserved regions seem to form complementary shapes. There's a rule about propagating borders and preserving values based on neighbor conditions. I notice patterns while checking specific rows, focusing on palindromic qualities and neighbors. The preserved regions are marked from a training set, revealing a comparison between input and output. Ultimately, I observe that the first and last rows are consistently filled with certain values, while the others are tracked for preserved digits, indicating broader trends in patterns.**Exploring preserved shapes**\n\nI'm focusing on the grid's boundary, where both the first and last rows always become 3, leading to a consistent outer layer. Inside, I see a contiguous region with original values surrounded by these 3s. I'm analyzing clusters of zeros to determine which ones are preserved, noting that clusters are connected cells of zeros. The largest cluster appears to have a ring-like shape, and it\u2019s interesting how some zeros are fully preserved while others are not. Let's keep identifying these patterns!**Confirming output grid**\n\nI've calculated the output grid as follows:\n\nRow1: 33333\n\nRow2: 50993\n\nRow3: 36553\n\nRow4: 33333\n\nNow I\u2019ll double-check against the input grid. \n\nFor Row1, input 47604 corresponds to output 33333. \n\nRow2 has an input of 50995 which results in the correct output of 50993. \n\nIn Row3, the input 76559 translates correctly, yielding 36553. \n\nFinally, Row4 comes out as 33333. So, that\u2019s my final answer!",
