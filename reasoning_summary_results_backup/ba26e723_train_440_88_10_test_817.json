The rule I\u2019ve deduced is to replace non-zero values in these columns with the number 6. In a 9x5 grid, I need to focus on columns 1 and 4 since they meet the criteria. As I adjust each cell in those columns, I\u2019ll set the non-zero values to 6 or keep the zeros as they are. It\u2019s all about maintaining that structure!**Updating grid rows**\n\nI'm applying the rule to each row, where columns 1 and 4 are transformed to 6 for non-zero values. For example, in row 1, the transformation turns 9 into 6 while other numbers remain unchanged. Each subsequent row follows this logic too. Finally, I check to ensure that all outputs maintain the correct length of 5 digits, which confirms my adjustments are correct. After going through all rows, I verify that my work produces the right results consistently!",
