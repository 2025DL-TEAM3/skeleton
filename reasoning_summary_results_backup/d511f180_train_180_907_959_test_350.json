    "reasoning": "**Analyzing input and output patterns**\n\nI\u2019m examining the input-output differences cell by cell. In the first row, the change is from 8 to 5, while the rest remain consistent. In the second row, several cells change, indicating more complex transformations. I wonder if there's symmetry or some pattern like rotations or reflections involved. Another idea is replacing each digit with its complement to 9, but that seems inconsistent. Maybe unique digits in rows or columns influence the replacements instead? This puzzle has many interesting layers!**Exploring cell changes in examples**\n\nI\u2019m going through some examples of input-output changes in grids. In the first example, it seems the transformation of certain digits is not straightforward, as only some components like '8' change to '5' while '9' and '0' remain the same. So what\u2019s the pattern? In the second example with a small grid, only specific cells change. The third example shows a clear rule of changing '5's to '8's, but not the reverse. I\u2019m curious if similar rules apply in the first example!**Decoding swaps between digits**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing a grid transformation where the digits 5 and 8 are swapped. In the examples, several checks confirm only these two digits change position, while the others remain untouched. Each row reveals similar patterns, notably in how each instance of 5 changes to 8 and vice versa. For a new input to process, I'll apply this established rule of swapping. Row by row, I\u2019ll transform the digits accordingly and double-check to ensure the transformations match expectations. Let's finalize the output grid!",
