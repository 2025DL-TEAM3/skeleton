    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC Puzzle**\n\nThis seems to be an ARC puzzle where specific digits transform into others. I've noticed from the provided examples that certain digits are highlighted, particularly clusters involving 1, 0, 4, and 9. For instance, the mapping confirms that 1 transforms to 2, and 6 does too in certain cases. Each input row retains its '8's as background while mapping others. I'll keep verifying how these transformations happen across the rows. It appears there's a pattern developing here!**Exploring Mapping Rules**\n\nI'm analyzing a mapping puzzle, where blobs of zeros or other digits transform into specific values. For instance, a blob of three zeros maps to 2s and size two blobs may map to 1s. But with variations, it's unclear how certain numbers relate to their mappings. I\u2019m considering factors like color or frequency of occurrence. It seems like there's complexity with how groups or shapes might correspond to digits or mappings. I need to keep checking these patterns and rules!**Mapping Shape Types**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how shapes in rows are mapped to outputs. For shapes 1, 6, 0, 4, and 9, I'm finding a pattern in which some map to 2 and others to 1. There seems to be a threshold based on their first appearances, where those in rows 1-6 get a 2, while rows 7-10 map to 1. I need to keep considering these rules and check if the mapping logic holds across different examples, ensuring consistency. It looks plausible so far!",
