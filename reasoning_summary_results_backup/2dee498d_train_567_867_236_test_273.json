If the digits are all the same, the output is that single digit.**Identifying minimal patterns in rows**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid with eight rows of digits where I need to extract the minimal repeating pattern from each row. For instance, in \"616161,\" I can identify \"61\" repeated three times as the minimal pattern output. Similarly, \"111111\" will yield \"1,\" since it's repeated six times.
