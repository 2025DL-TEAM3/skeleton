    "reasoning": "**Clarifying digit transformations**\n\nI'm looking at the transformation of digits based on the examples. In the first example, it looks like every '5' is mapped to '8', while '0' stays '0'. No '5' remains '5', making this a straightforward rule: change all '5's to '8's. In the second example, some '7's remain the same while others change to '8'. It seems the rule is to keep the first occurrence of each digit in a row while changing subsequent duplicates. I need to confirm this pattern!**Finding clusters in a grid**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid to identify clusters of non-zero colors, specifically '1's in this case. The goal is simple: clusters of size 2 or more will change to '8', while single '1's are left alone. Zeros will remain as zeros.\n\nI'll start by identifying connected '1's using four-directional connectivity. After parsing the grid, I've found several '1' positions to check. As I explore each position, I\u2019ll determine whether they form clusters or remain singletons. I need to keep track of these connections!**Tracing cluster transformations**\n\nI'm mapping clusters in the grid, starting from (6,0) and working my way through connected '1's. After identifying neighbors, I've found that clusters of size 2 or more will change to '8', while single '1's stay as '1'. For instance, cluster sizes are 4 and 3, while several singletons remain.\n\nNow, I\u2019ll output the grid row by row. It's essential to ensure each row has five characters, confirming all clusters and singletons are represented correctly. Everything seems consistent with the rules established from previous examples!",
