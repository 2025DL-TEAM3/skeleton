Let\u2019s visualize Row 4 before and after:\n\nRow 4 starts as 8 6 6 2 2 8 6 8, and becomes 6 6 6 2 2 8 6 8 after modifying the first column.\n\nIn Row 5, both 8s in columns 3 and 4 change to 6s, while Row 6 sees changes in columns 1 and 2. \n\nIt\u2019s interesting that column 5 remains an 8. Could that be due to a different cluster region?**Clarifying column changes**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how certain values change in a puzzle involving rows of 8s and 6s. In Row 7, the positions of 8s in columns 1, 3, and 5 change, but column 5 remains an 8. This leads me to examine rows 4 to 7. \n\nAfter checking, I see some 8s change to 6s in a specific region, primarily in columns 1 to 4. The 2s remain unchanged. So, in essence, the changes are focused on that subgrid while keeping the boundaries intact!**Refining interior fills**\n\nI'm looking to fill the interior of a barrier triangle with 1s, similar to the earlier example. This means I'll focus on rows 5 through 7, specifically working on the right side.\n\nFor Row 5, the rightmost barrier is at column 4, so I\u2019ll fill columns 5 through 8 with 1s, changing the row to 12221111. In Row 6, I adjust columns 4 to 8 as well, also updating to 12211111. Row 7 will change to 12111111.\n\nWhile Row 8 has barriers, it seems the fill should skip it. Thus, my final output reflects these changes accurately!",
