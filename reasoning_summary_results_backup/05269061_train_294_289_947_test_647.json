    "reasoning": "**Examining number transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing how zeros transform in a sequence of numbers. The input \"0019\" turns into \"9919,\" which suggests the zeros were replaced by nines. In the explanations, it looks like in some rows, zeros become nines, while in others, they change to ones. For instance, in \"1990,\" the zero at the end turns into one. This leads me to think that the replacement of zeros varies depending on the row. Interesting how the method seems to map differently across each row!**Analyzing number transformations in rows**\n\nI'm looking at a grid where zeros are replaced based on patterns formed by the other numbers. In the first example, the zeros in \"004\" became 6 and 8, while the unchanging values stayed fixed. It seems like the zeros are filled in a way that maintains order and creates a sequence. \n\nIn the second example, rows filled with zeros shift to either fives or sevens based on patterns. The filling strategy looks to alternate based on surrounding data, which makes me curious about the rules governing this transformation!**Identifying patterns in grids**\n\nI\u2019m exploring how grid patterns emerge, observing a repeating sequence of numbers in a 3x3 tile structure. For instance, it looks like rows with zeros fill in based on a consistent pattern of 5s and 7s every three rows, depending on their index. I noticed that zeros might be replaced by values derived from neighboring rows, and the output can cycle through shifts as seen in the numeric sequences. It's intriguing to see how the uniform constant extends the pattern based on row indexes.",
