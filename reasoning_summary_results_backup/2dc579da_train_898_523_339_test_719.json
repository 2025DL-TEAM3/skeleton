For instance, in the given input where rows contain numbers, I find that row two has a unique digit '7' in column two. I start analyzing the columns to identify distinct non-repeating digits. The columns reveal that column two contains three unique digits. But I'm questioning the logic behind how the output \"37\" was derived and consider whether I should also look for shapes formed by the digits.**Evaluating clusters and outputs**\n\nI'm analyzing how they extracted cluster coordinates from the example. It looks like they selected a bottom cluster in row three instead of the top cluster in row one. In another example, I'm noting the distribution of zeros and nines in different clusters. For the zeros, they categorized several clusters and identified how they connected with the nines. The output \"99990\" combines parts of different clusters, suggesting they consider adjacency in their selection process. It seems they treat all non-background digits as connected.**Identifying mixed clusters**\n\nI'm analyzing clusters in a grid and how they select the right ones based on distinct values. In the example, I notice they seem to prioritize clusters with a mix of non-background colors, like the one containing both 7 and 6. The cluster at column 8 positions 1-2 stands out as unique because it\u2019s the only one with differing values. I also reflect on how they handle adjacency between clusters, merging them based on non-background characteristics while ensuring they capture the right bounding boxes.",
