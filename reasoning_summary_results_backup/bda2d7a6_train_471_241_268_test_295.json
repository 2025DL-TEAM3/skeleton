For each puzzle, I identify distinct values and their orientation\u2014outer frame, middle, inner. In one example, I see that 9 is the outer frame, 2 is next, and 3 is innermost. They map to each other as 9 goes to 3, 3 goes to 2, and so on. I'm trying to understand how inner shapes interact as they replace each other in the cycle. It's a bit tricky!**Examining nested shapes**\n\nI'm analyzing nested shapes in a new example with a background of 1, a ring of 6, and a smaller ring of 4. Following a grid layout, I see the outer border made up of 1s, the next layer with 6s, and then 4s forming the innermost rectangle. The output will involve mapping these values in a cycle: the border value changes to the innermost region, and I will maintain this rule while confirming dimensions and coordinates for the grids in each example. It's quite intricate!**Mapping nested values**\n\nI'm figuring out how to define the values in a nested ring structure. The outer layer, or border, is comprised of 1s, the second layer uses 6s, and the inner area is filled with 9s. The plan is to rotate these values, so the border will take on the inner value, while the inner takes the middle value. I\u2019ve worked through the patterns and confirmed the output grid, so it looks like the final arrangement will be:  \n\n```\n999999\n911119\n916619\n916619\n916619\n916619\n911119\n999999\n```  \nI\u2019m pleased with how it's turned out!",
