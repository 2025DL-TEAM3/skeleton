There\u2019s an 8x8 grid with a pattern that seems to shift unique colored cells to the front of each row. For instance, I notice that in the input, the unique values appear in specific positions in the last rows. I'm trying to confirm how these shifts work and keep track of the indices properly. There's definitely a pattern in the placement of numbers!**Investigating propagation patterns**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the propagation rules in this matrix transformation. It looks like they're filling in values based on previously colored pixels, specifically looking at diagonal movements. In row 6, I see an added '8' coming from row 5, column 8. It seems they're only doing this for certain colors and not others, which is puzzling. I need to clarify why some colors propagate and others don\u2019t, especially since there are other colored pixels present that seem untouched. Maybe there's a specific rule for how and when these propagate!**Examining propagation rules**\n\nI'm exploring propagation rules for color chains in a matrix grid. It appears that there's a chain of '3s' and '9s' moving backward and down-left. The confusion arises with a '9' added at (6,5) from the existing grid. I've identified diagonal chains for certain colors, and I need to clarify why some propagate while others don\u2019t. Each colored pixel seems to have specific rules\u2014like extending chains based on diagonal orientations\u2014which I need to fully understand for consistent filling!**Verifying grid propagation**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid with defined chains of colors to propagate. I notice a chain of '8s' and '6s', determining their slopes and filling cells accordingly. The propagation method involves finding connections between non-background pixels, while ensuring they meet the length requirement. I\u2019m extracting coordinates and verifying that there are no conflicts when filling in new values. The final output seems accurate, and I need to present it structured by rows while ensuring all values match expectations!",
