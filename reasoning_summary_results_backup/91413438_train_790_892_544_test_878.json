    "reasoning": "**Analyzing ARC puzzle structure**\n\nThis puzzle involves mapping small grids and consists of three examples provided for training. The first input block forms a 9x9 grid, repeating the 3x3 input in a 2x2 arrangement. It\u2019s evident that the first six rows consist of repeated patterns from the input, filled similarly in the next three rows with zeros at the bottom. In the second example, though, I notice that the output suggests an adjustment in the number of columns. I'll have to investigate further!**Decoding grid output**\n\nThe output presents a 6x9 grid with two input rows repeated horizontally three times, followed by four rows of zeros. It's a bit puzzling that the input, which consists of only two rows, contributes to the output\u2019s first two blocks. So, I see this vertical repetition results in a total of six rows: two filled with input and four filled with zeros. The pattern seems consistent across both examples, but I'm curious about the rationale behind those additional zero rows. Let\u2019s analyze further!**Constructing grid output**\n\nRows one to three display the input repeated horizontally three times, creating a width of nine columns. The next six rows consist entirely of zeros, also with a length of nine. Thus, when I compile the grid, I have: \n\n066066066  \n066066066  \n660660660  \n000000000  \n000000000  \n000000000  \n000000000  \n000000000  \n000000000  \n\nI\u2019m following the instructions to only provide the output grid, ensuring it consists of the expected nine lines.",
