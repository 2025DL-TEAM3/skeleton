    "reasoning": "**Beginning analysis of ARC task**\n\nI'm starting with this ARC task involving a 9x9 input grid. My goal is to identify the rule based on three provided training examples. There's a lot to consider, like patterns, sequences, and relationships within the examples. It feels a bit complex, but I'm eager to break it down step by step. I wonder what insights I can gather from these examples to apply them effectively in the grid. Let's dive into the details!**Identifying transposition rule**\n\nI'm breaking down the example input, which consists of seven rows of seven numbers. My initial observation is that the output might involve rotating or transposing the matrix, as it seems to reflect the input structure in some way. \n\nEach output row appears to match up with the corresponding input column. Since the input creates a diagonal of nines, I realize that the output represents a direct transposition. I'll conclude that the rule here is that the output is indeed the transpose of the input.**Determining reflection rule and transposing**\n\nI'm analyzing the 9x9 grid to identify the reflection rule by observing anomalies like the diagonal of 2's. This diagonal serves as an axis of symmetry, suggesting that the other numbers create a pattern around it, forming a staircase effect. It seems non-background values are trailing off to the right of this diagonal. \n\nGiven that the main diagonal of 2s determines our symmetry, I realize that transposing the grid is the way to go! I\u2019ll compute the transpose, so each row becomes a column. Let\u2019s list this out clearly!**Finding transposed output**\n\nI've laid out the input grid and identified the columns that need to become rows in the output. For example, output row 1 reflects input column 1, and so on for the remaining rows. After organizing these, I double-checked each column calculation to ensure accuracy.\n\nThe final output consists of strings of digits representing the transposed 9x9 grid. Now that I've confirmed that all values match as intended, I see that the structure looks good! I can confidently proceed with this formatted final answer.",
