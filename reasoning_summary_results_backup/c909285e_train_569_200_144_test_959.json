    "reasoning": "**Examining number patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at three examples where the inputs consist of rows of digit strings, and the outputs are lists of shorter strings. For instance, in the first example with a 10x10 input, four 4-digit outputs emerge, possibly from clusters or patterns within the input. I'm curious about how these outputs relate to the inputs in terms of the digit arrangements and whether there are repeated features or counts involved. It's essential to analyze example one closely to uncover the underlying rule.**Analyzing digit clusters**\n\nI'm observing a pattern within numerous rows of digits, primarily focusing on the digit 9 as the background. Certain rows repeatedly feature the sequence 8967999999, while others, like row 4 (8122221111), showcase clusters of twos and ones. I notice that columns show consistent digits, especially the first column always being 8, hinting at a shape or figure emerging from the non-9 digits. I need to visualize this grid to pinpoint a contiguous area of non-9 cells, ultimately helping me understand how the resultant four rows outputted.**Identifying number borders**\n\nI'm analyzing a grid to find a 3x3 region completely surrounded by 2s. Looking at my rewritten grid, I'm noticing that there's a frame of 2s around a center of 8s and one 5. Specifically, in rows 6-8 and columns 2-4, I see a 3x3 area with 8s. Checking the neighbors, there are some non-2s present, but the goal is to ensure a complete border. The pattern seems similar to a previous example, where a central block was also surrounded by a consistent number. I need to extract the relevant 3x3 block for clarity.**Determining uniform regions**\n\nI'm exploring a grid to find a 6x6 region with a border color of 2. Initially, I check various subregions, and while I find several 6x6 candidates, I focus on the one starting from rows 1 to 6, columns 1 to 6. That subgrid shows a uniform border of 2s while the interior contains some 5s. I confirm the smallest size and ensure everything is uniform. The expected output format should reflect the size of the detected region, ultimately yielding a 6x6 grid filled with those values.",
