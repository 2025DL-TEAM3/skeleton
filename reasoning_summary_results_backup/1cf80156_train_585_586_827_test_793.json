The example I have shows a 7-row grid with zeros in the top five rows. In rows six and seven, there are specified values that create an L shape. I need to visualize it as a 2x2 grid that summarizes the relevant part, which seems to be located in the bottom-left corner. I\u2019m wondering how this L shape is oriented.**Analyzing bounding boxes**\n\nI'm examining how to determine a minimal bounding box using pixel colors. In the current example, rows six and seven contain the number 5 in specific columns, and they together form a diagonal shape. \n\nThis pattern helps clarify how to extract the bounding box, which captures all non-zero or non-dominant elements. A new example shows three rows of 9's with zeros that signal their own bounding box. Each scenario focuses on cropping areas with distinct colors, separating them effectively from the background.**Determining the bounding grid**\n\nI'm analyzing a 10-row grid, focusing on rows with '1' as the foreground versus '5' as the background. The relevant pixels are in rows six to ten and columns one to three. I need to extract a 5x3 bounding box, which includes all the '1's. After verifying the entries, the output should read as five lines of digits without spaces. \n\nFinally, I confirm the output as:\n\n111  \n511  \n111  \n111  \n111",
