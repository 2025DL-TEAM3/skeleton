In the first example, I notice the output is just the input flipped top to bottom. Similarly, the second example follows the same pattern, showing a clear vertical symmetry.\n\nFor the third example with the 9x9 matrix, it's a bit more complex. I need to carefully analyze how the rows are rearranged differently than a simple flip. There's definitely more nuance in this transformation that I will need to explore further.**Exploring matrix transformations**\n\nI'm analyzing how the output rows relate to the input rows in this matrix. It looks like the outputs are not just simple vertical flips but might involve some kind of transformation, like a rotation or reflective change. As I inspect the mapping by row, I see some relationships, but they aren't consistently following any straightforward pattern. \n\nI need to consider the potential for complex modifications like inverting certain digits or reflecting columns. It's clear that the third example diverges from the straightforward transformations of the first two, so I need to test various hypotheses to clarify the rules at play here.**Examining matrix transformations**\n\nI'm examining the patterns in how the rows from the input transform into the output. The second example seems straightforward as a vertical flip, while the third example appears to involve more complex rules, possibly including rotations and modifications of the digits. \n\nAs I delve deeper, I wonder if the final output is actually a 180-degree rotation of the input rows rather than just reversing them. I need to explore how changing certain digits interacts with the overarching pattern and confirms my hypothesis.**Interpreting patterns and transformations**\n\nI've been analyzing the transformations from the input to the output, noticing that some examples seem to involve symmetrical shapes and potential horizontal flips or rotations. \n\nIn input three, I'm seeing how digits other than 7 create specific patterns that might represent numbers. It seems the output could be a 180-degree rotation of these inputs, mapping colors while retaining the structural shapes. I need to confirm this idea with the new test input and see if a simpler vertical flip is appropriate, similar to the earlier examples. Let's clarify this!",
