I think this makes row 2 more uniform, which could make it the better choice. However, I realize there\u2019s a rule to select the \"dominant row\" based on the highest count of the majority digit. Both have a max of five. For the tie-breaker, row 2 has fewer distinct digits than row 7, so it gets chosen. This logic aligns well with the expected outcome since row 2 doesn\u2019t include any zeros.**Proposing a replacement rule**\n\nI'm considering a rule for replacing each row with its most frequent digit from the input. In the second case, there's a tie in row 2 with two ones, fours, and sixes, so the output shows 1114466 instead of 1111111. This suggests I shouldn\u2019t replace each row independently but rather find a global pattern.\n\nI realize I'll need to focus on finding rows grouped by majority digit, clustering them into groups for proper replacement. In Example 1, the rows are dominated by either 4 or 8, and I believe that\u2019s consistent with the output.",
