In the first example, I note the input has four rows of six digits, like 090909 and 303030. When I inspect the outputs, I've found they only take the first two digits from each input row. So, for 090909, it gives 09; for 303030, it\u2019s 30, and so on. It\u2019s a clear pattern I\u2019m beginning to understand!**Extracting Substring Patterns**\n\nLooking at the second example, I identify a clear pattern in the outputs: for inputs like 383838 and 252525, the output is just the repeating substring, like 38 and 25, respectively. In the third example, inputs like 000 and 888 yield a single character that repeats, with outputs being just 0 and 8. I see this as a consistent method: for each input row, I need to find the smallest repeating unit and extract that. For input like 565656, the output will be 56 and for 696969, it'll be 69. I\u2019ll format the final output correctly!",
