    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit grid mappings**\n\nI'm working on a puzzle involving grids of digits where input and output grids need to match in dimensions. I've got three training sets with various input-output pairs to decipher the underlying rule. \n\nLooking at the first training set, I'm starting with the input grid. The first row maps the digits from the input to the output row successfully, with specific attention needed for how the second row maps. It's crucial to verify if I've interpreted these mappings correctly.**Exploring grid mappings**\n\nI'm analyzing digit grids across training sets to identify a rule that maps input rows to output rows. In the first set, I've noted how each row transforms, with intriguing results like reversing certain inputs to yield outputs. \n\nThe second training set presents a series of new grids, while the third has 10 rows of 8 digits. I suspect there's a consistent deterministic pattern at play, perhaps involving reversing or rearranging digits from the inputs. It\u2019s essential to keep comparing inputs with outputs to find the reliable transformations.**Establishing the rotation rule**\n\nI'm identifying a rule: the output row is the reverse of the input row. It seems like I need to reverse both the order of the rows and the individual rows, essentially performing a 180-degree rotation of the grid. \n\nFor the first and second training sets, I confirmed that reversing the row order and reversing each row yields corresponding outputs. Now, for the third training set, I\u2019m checking a 10x8 grid and found that I had accurately copied the inputs. The consistent rule appears to always be this 180-degree rotation process. \n\nHere\u2019s the final output for the test input grid I've processed.",
