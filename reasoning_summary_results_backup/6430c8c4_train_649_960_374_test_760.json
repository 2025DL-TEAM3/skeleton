    "reasoning": "**Analyzing mapping inconsistencies**\n\nI'm trying to understand a mapping where inputs seem inconsistent. For instance, it looks like there's an output row where digits 8, 7, and 0 map to 8, 3, and 8, respectively. But the mapping appears strange, especially how 0 changes from mapping to 8 to 3. \n\nI\u2019m pondering if there's a pattern involving 7s, possibly filling in gaps with a specific color or cropping around them. This is tricky, and I'm not quite sure yet how to resolve these puzzling inconsistencies!**Evaluating output symmetry and mapping**\n\nI'm analyzing the output patterns and trying to determine if there's a consistent central line. The examples show some oddities, especially in symmetry, like how row outputs like [3, 8, 8] don't align neatly.\n\nMoving onto a different example, I see a 5x5 input that results in a 2x5 output. It looks like the last two rows contribute to the output, mapping values from 2 to 3 and 7 to 2 effectively. I\u2019m curious about the regions chosen for mapping and cropping. It's fascinating, though still puzzling!**Examining cropping regions and mapping**\n\nI\u2019m considering how to choose regions based on the occurrence of certain values like 7s within blocks of 5s. It seems the first 7 appears in row 4, so they selected the rows containing that, cropping them entirely.\n\nFor another example, I see the need to analyze how 8s surround 7s and if they form a connected area. It looks like they take all regions encompassing the first 7 and analyze them for mapping. Still, I'm not sure about the consistency of the outputs, as it feels like there are many nuances to these mappings that seem off!",
