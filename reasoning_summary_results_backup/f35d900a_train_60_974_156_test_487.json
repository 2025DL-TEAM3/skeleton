The key is understanding distances from specific points (row 2 and row 10) and outputting a Manhattan distance pattern. I\u2019m considering a function that computes how far each row is from these points. For instance, if r equals 2, the distance to row 2 is 0 and to row 10 is 8, leading to an output of 4. Let\u2019s explore this further!**Calculating row outputs**\n\nI've assessed the distances and outputs for each row, and I'm starting to see a correlation. For example, row 3 has d2=1 and d10=7, giving an output of 2. I notice the output can relate to the nearest source and the calculated distances. At row 1, I find that f(1) = 2, but there's some inconsistency when checking row 9. Although it should output 4 based on earlier calculations, I'm realizing f(1) consistently seems to be 2 at certain points. I need to clarify these relationships further!**Exploring function behaviors**\n\nI'm examining possible behavior coefficients for an example grid. As I analyze distances and outputs across different rows, I find that certain patterns may define the outputs based on the nearest sources. It seems like distances determine values, but I'm realizing not all examples share the same rule. The key sources and their relationships give way to a general transformation rule, which should align with the outputs. I\u2019m particularly intrigued by how to derive and test function values, ensuring they remain consistent across various distances. Let\u2019s keep testing these relationships!**Analyzing distance functions**\n\nI'm working through distances in a grid to determine output values based on proximity to sources. It\u2019s clear that picking cells far from sources helps evaluate how they relate. When exploring overlapping regions, it seems the outputs revert to the default input color when equidistant between sources. I'm figuring out that alternating colors in different rings based on distance can yield distinct patterns, with some unique rules on how to handle ties. This is quite intricate, but I\u2019m trying to define a strategy that addresses the various scenarios!",
