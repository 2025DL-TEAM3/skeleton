For instance, in the first example, the input \u201c700\u201d becomes \u201c200,\u201d indicating that 7 maps to 2, while 0 remains unchanged. The structure follows a pattern where 6 rows of input yield 9 rows of output. For instance, the input \u201c666000000\u201d translates to \u201c222000000,\u201d suggesting a consistent division by 3 for digits. It seems I'm extracting a rule here that applies broadly to these examples!**Clarifying digit mapping**\n\nI'm exploring the mapping of digits within number grids. The mapping suggests that any non-zero digit like 7 or 6 transforms into 2, while 0 remains unchanged. For example, in the input \"700\", the 7 maps to 2, and similarly for other cases. This transformation fits a consistent rule where non-zero digits become 2. Additionally, the input structure always has 6 rows, and the output expands to 9 rows while maintaining the same width and follows a vertical repetition. It's quite an interesting pattern!",
