The first input has five lines, but the output has six, which doesn't add up. \n\nThen, in the second example, the input shows seven identical rows of nine digits, but the output has nine rows instead. It seems there may be an error or misunderstanding in interpreting the data structure\u2014like extra blank lines or counting issues. I need to clarify this further!**Exploring transposition rules**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how the input grids transform into outputs. I see some consistent patterns with dimensions flipping: for example, in one case, a 7x9 input becomes a 9x7 output. \n\nWhen looking at another case, a 4x4 input remains 4x4 after transposing, meaning the output reflects the original arrangement. Transposing seems to be the core rule here, swapping rows and columns.\n\nLet's validate these transformations to ensure digits are correctly mapped across the grids. So far, it looks like they follow the substitution rules as well!**Determining output from input grid**\n\nI'm analyzing the input matrix composed of 9 rows and 4 columns. When I transpose this matrix, I expect the output to have 4 rows and 9 columns. \n\nEach new output row is derived from the respective column of the input grid, which I calculate step by step. For instance, the first column translates into \"404074407\" and so on for each column. I need to ensure that all output rows have 9 digits. After verifying this, I can confirm that the final output matches the expected format and aesthetics.",
