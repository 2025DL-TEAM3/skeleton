    "reasoning": "**Examining connected components**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a specific pattern in the grid involving the number 4. It seems like there\u2019s a diamond or plus shape around the coordinates (5,0). I need to isolate and examine the connected components of the number 4 in the grid. From my observations, it looks like there are two components of 4s\u2014one above and one below, where they connect downward, forming a larger shape. Maybe they only paint the 4s that are part of that upward pattern.**Analyzing color patterns**\n\nIt seems they painted only the 4s that are above a certain row, possibly row 6, leaving rows 6 to 8 untouched. I think the rule might be to fill the top half of the shape using a checker pattern with colors 0 and 5. Looking at example 2, it\u2019s a 9x9 grid where I\u2019m trying to determine how the 3s are altered to 9 or 2. I\u2019ll track the specific changes from input to output and examine how the 3s shift based on their positions in the grid.**Investigating color changes**\n\nI see that only certain 3s are changing\u2014specifically those within a defined region, likely forming a \"plus\" or donut shape. I\u2019m trying to map the 3s and check which ones remain unchanged. The shapes I\u2019m examining seem symmetric, and when they contain central targets like 4s, the filled area is treated with alternating colors. It seems the transformation of colors depends on their positions within that target region, like defining a chessboard pattern based on Manhattan distance. I want to confirm which positions were actually altered in the grid.**Applying transformation patterns**\n\nI'm iterating through rows 3 to 8 and checking specific columns. For each position containing a 3, I'll apply a pattern based on whether the row is odd or even, deciding values for each region. As I map out the positions, I see changes happening mainly in rows 3, 5, 6, and 7, but row 4 remains unchanged. I\u2019ll produce the final output grid carefully, making sure all transformations follow the established pattern consistently, while double-checking for accuracy in the final output.",
