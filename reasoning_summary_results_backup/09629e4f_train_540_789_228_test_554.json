The top half has distinct coordinates where digits are not equal to 3. The bottom half shares a pattern in positions, but the colors differ. I realize the bottom shapes are reflected vertically around row three. The mapping between corresponding positions doesn\u2019t line up perfectly because of the color differences. It\u2019s intriguing to see the variations and symmetry in these shapes!**Reflecting on shape and color output**\n\nI'm exploring why the bottom shape colors differ from the top shapes. It seems like the bottom output in rows 4 and 5 is uniform with the pattern 55377, while the top is 77377. This means there\u2019s a transformation happening, where the first two digits transform from 7 to 5 based on the input. I wonder if the colors of the bottom half might represent the second most common color from the top, though that theory doesn\u2019t hold up across examples. I'm observing that the central value in the output remains consistent, which is reassuring!**Determining color patterns**\n\nI'm analyzing examples to understand how to determine the output based on the majority and minority colors for different rows. For the top half, I note that the majority color dictates the output format. However, for the bottom half, it seems I need to use the second most common color instead, as seen in various examples. This contrasts with the top half\u2019s consistent approach, so I\u2019m trying to solidify the rules for each section, especially focusing on how column selections might differ between majority and minority.",
