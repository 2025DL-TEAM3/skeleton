Similarly, Row 2 supports a [4, 9, 4][4, 9, 4] pattern. I see that the output seems to be a duplication of a 3x3 grid. This grid is made up of rows 8 to 10 and columns 2 to 4, which confirm it matches the 3x3 pattern from the specific input area defined by the 4's.**Identifying and extracting regions**\n\nI\u2019m examining a process in which a 3x3 patch gets extracted and then tiled horizontally to form 3 rows of double the width. The patch has a uniform background of 9s and marked corners by 4s. The output is built by detecting the bounding box of non-background regions and taking two copies of this region side by side. \n\nIn different examples, like rows full of zeros and spots with values, the outputs reflect this tiling method consistently. The output always results from horizontally concatenating copies of the identified regions.**Analyzing bounding box and output**\n\nI'm working with a grid of 7 rows by 8 columns, where most cells are zeros, except for several 8s. I've identified the positions of these non-zero numbers, particularly noting that the bounding box spans from Row 4 to Row 7 and Columns 6 to 7. Extracting this gives me a 4x2 region. \n\nWhen I concatenate two copies of this subgrid horizontally, the output is a 4x4 grid represented without spaces, leading to the final answer being:\n\n8888  \n0808  \n8888  \n0808  \n\nI also briefly consider whether the number of copies varies. In all examples, it appears to be consistently two.**Confirming output patterns**\n\nIn example 1, the extracted region is 3x3, and when they concatenated two copies horizontally, it results in 3x6. In example 2, a 1x1 region becomes 1x2. For example 3, a 1x2 region becomes 1x4. Now, for my current case, I have a 4x2 region, and when I replicate it horizontally, it results in a 4x4 output.
