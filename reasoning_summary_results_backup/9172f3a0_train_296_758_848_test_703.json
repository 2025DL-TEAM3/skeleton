The inputs are three rows with three digits each, and the outputs are structured as nine rows with nine digits each. \n\nFor instance, in the first example, I see that each digit in a 3x3 grid is expanded into a block of nine in the output. This seems to suggest a rule where rows and columns from the original puzzle dictate the numbers and quantities in the transformed version. \n\nI\u2019ll keep analyzing the examples for consistency!**Identifying input-output rules**\n\nIn this example, I\u2019m unraveling an input-output relationship. The input consists of a 2x2 grid which transforms into a 6x6 grid. The rule seems to be that each input cell expands into a 3x3 block within the output grid. \n\nFor instance, inputting \"91\" and \"01\" results in a uniform pattern where each block in the output reflects the corresponding value from the input. I\u2019m noticing that this consistent block size of 3 simplifies the transformation process, as each cell's value fills the 3x3 area in the output grid.**Exploring output grid rules**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing an input of a 3x3 grid, where I\u2019ll produce a 9x9 output with 3x3 blocks. I see that each row of the input is expanded into three corresponding rows in the output, where each cell is filled uniformly based on its value. For instance, a cell with \"0\" will become \"000,\" \"8\" becomes \"888,\" and \"3\" turns into \"333.\" \n\nI noticed that the block size remains consistently 3, regardless of how many distinct values are in the input. So, it seems that I can confidently conclude the output grid details!",
