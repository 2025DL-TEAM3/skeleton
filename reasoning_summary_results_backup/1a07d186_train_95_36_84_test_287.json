    "reasoning": "**Analyzing index positioning**\n\nOkay, so for the number \"7777727777,\" I'm noting that the 2 appears at position 5 when counting from zero. It seems everywhere else that's not a 7 gets replaced, except for specific rows like 5 and 7. When I look at my example systematically, I see that each row consistently yields all 7s, except for row 5, which retains \"7777727777.\" I think I need to clarify which column holds the 2 and how that corresponds to the output.**Evaluating row outputs**\n\nLet\u2019s check row 6, which is all 2s. I wonder why column 4 was chosen. In row 7, I notice non-7s are replaced with 7s, with 7311767777 becoming all 7s. Row 5 is originally all 7s, so it remains unchanged despite inserting a 2. It seems they picked a cell from the row below. Row 6\u2019s uniformity emphasizes its unique 2. In example 1, it's clear: most rows output all 6s except one, which hints at a specific replacement rule.**Analyzing row outputs and patterns**\n\nI'm examining row 1 from the grid and noting its output positions. It has two 5s at positions 5 and 6, resulting from replacing non-6 digits. Then, I check row 6 in the examples and realize it's all 2s, which remain unchanged. However, row 5 copies a feature from row 6 by inserting a 2. Looking at example 3, no rows are entirely uniform, and I consider how the task is to fill the grid with the majority number while possibly copying a minority feature nearby. I wonder if identifying the frequent colors is a key part of the task.**Finalizing the output**\n\nI need to confirm that we're only working with the necessary data. According to the rule, any stray values should be moved next to the uniform row, specifically from rows above, since we don't have any from below. This looks good. I have ensured the uniform row is preserved entirely. With that in mind, I'm ready to return the final lines as the output.",
