For instance, 522522522 outputs 522 because it\u2019s 522 repeated three times. The second example, 222222222, produces 222 rather than just 2. It seems that they derive the block length by dividing the total length by three, consistently extracting the first third. Therefore, even when the minimal block could be shorter, the approach always favors the repetition of that first third instead. That\u2019s an interesting pattern!**Identifying output patterns**\n\nI see that the consistent repeating pattern means the block length is always the total length divided by three. In Example 2, for the input 343434, its length of 6 results in an output length of 2, giving us \"34\". \n\nIn the test with 9-character rows, I\u2019ll extract the first three characters based on this rule. So for each of the 8 rows provided, the outputs will be:\n\n1. 522 -> 522\n2. 826 -> 826\n3. 222 -> 222\n4. 126 -> 126\n5. 222 -> 222\n6. 812 -> 812\n7. 222 -> 222\n8. 888 -> 888\n\nThis confirms the outputs!",
