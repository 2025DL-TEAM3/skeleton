It seems like shifting two 4's to the right gives me an output of 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, which is a left rotation by 2 positions. But with the second row input 2, 9, 2, 2, 2, my results don't align as expected. After left-2 rotation, I get 2, 2, 2, 2, 9, but the output shows 2, 2, 2, 9, 2. There\u2019s a discrepancy to resolve!**Exploring rotation patterns**\n\nI'm considering rotating rows right by two positions. For example, with an input like [4, 4, 2, 2, 2], the rotation yields [2, 2, 4, 4, 2], but the expected output is [2, 2, 2, 4, 4], which doesn't match. I\u2019m noticing inconsistencies, like needing three positions instead. It might be about sorting by frequency or moving outliers, like the large digit, to the end. Understanding how the outlier positions change may reveal a pattern!",
