    "reasoning": "**Identifying dominant motif**\n\nI\u2019m noticing that in most rows, particularly those like 4474, there's a consistent 7 in column 2. Looking closely, rows 0, 1, and 2 also show this pattern. However, the odd row 2222 lacks this 7, which we need to address. To match the motif, I\u2019ll change the value in column 2 of that row to 7, resulting in 2272. This way, I\u2019m ensuring consistency across the rows.**Identifying pattern rules**\n\nIn example 1, I see that rows 1, 2, and 4 contain 3's at column positions 5 and 6. But row 3 has those same values yet outputs as 00000000, indicating the 3's were removed instead of preserved. The odd row seems to be the one primarily filled with 0's, which might mean we need to zero out colored bits to maintain a blank background. \n\nLooking at the third example, it\u2019s clear that row 1 was adjusted to include zeros at positions 5 and 6 to match the common pattern, highlighting the importance of identifying such zeros across rows.**Examining motifs in rows**\n\nI\u2019m trying to find where most rows have zeros, which represent a background. In example 1, row 3 has zeros in columns 0-4 and 7, but columns 5 and 6 contain 3's. Rows 1, 2, and 4, don\u2019t have zeros, just 1 and 3. It seems the colored blocks are located in those columns in the majority of rows. We need to remove the colored features from the unique background row, which is row 3, effectively zeroing out values there to match the background. \n\nFor example 2, that odd row should match the motif found in other rows, meaning it also requires adjustments. The concept seems to be symmetrical\u2014adjusting the odd row while clearing any discrepancies to align with the broader motif.",
