Each matrix has undergone specific digit changes based on their positions.

In each case, 7s are consistently replaced by 5s, while other numbers remain unchanged. For instance, in the first example, every 7 becomes a 5, and the same pattern follows in the subsequent examples. It seems there\u2019s no special rule for other numbers, so it\u2019s clear that the transformation is all about changing 7s to 5s. My final output will have this pattern reflected, staying true to the original order.",
