    "reasoning": "**Analyzing shape patterns**\n\nIt looks like in Row 4, I see both a 0 and a 1, while Row 7 only has a 5 without any 0s, which is interesting. I think I need to focus on the shapes. The training examples likely highlight a shape in the input and then translate it into an output shape. It seems that they might override the grid to show one of two patterns. I'll extract the positions of non-8 digits from my dataset for better understanding. For Row 1, I note the non-8 positions are at column 2, column 3, and column 4, with the actual output in column 4 being a 6 only.**Examining non-8 patterns**\n\nIt seems that in Row 1, non-8 digits replaced columns 2 and 3 with 8s, leaving column 4 as 6. It looks like they're reducing multiple points to one central point; the region in Row 1 spans columns 2-4, with the center likely being column 3. However, column 4 is the selected output, which is the rightmost choice. In Row 2, non-8 positions span columns 4-5, with 6 in column 4 as well. This makes me curious about the consistent choice of column 4 as the pivot for outputs, suggesting they always turn to this column for root values.**Investigating row patterns**\n\nI\u2019m looking at Row 7, which has two 6s at the edges\u2014similar to Row 4. I suspect the input may show shapes where the number 8 forms a region with other digits creating 'holes.' They could be identifying shapes like a \u2018snake\u2019 or 'rectangle' and want a central color. From different datasets, it looks like only columns 5, 7, and 9 are showing the digit 2 in the output pattern across rows. It seems they have a tendency to favor a fixed pattern while rows with predominantly different digits output differently. This pattern suggests a general structure rather than a specific replication of input.**Identifying patterns in input**\n\nI need to find patterns of the digit 7 that appear exactly twice within the input data. I'll designate patternA as the one closer to the center and with more occurrences, focusing on positions where 7 appears. After analyzing each row, I identify that Rows 1 and 9 have positions [2,5,6] for 7s, while Rows 2 and 3 have [1,10]. For the output, patternA will fill most rows with 7s appearing at those specific columns, while Rows 2 and 3\u2014our special cases\u2014will be filled entirely with 7s. Thus, the resulting grid will reflect these choices consistently across the rows.",
