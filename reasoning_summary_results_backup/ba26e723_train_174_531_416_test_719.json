For the first example with a 5x9 grid, I see specific numbers changing across the rows. The outputs indicate certain positions might be affected, such as position 4 in row 2, marking it as a potential modification point. I need to record the coordinates from columns 0-8 for better clarity on how these changes relate to the rules. Let's keep exploring these transformations!**Identifying Changes in Grid**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing the grid for changes from input to output. Notably, row changes occur in specific columns, such as column 0 changing from 5 to 6 in row 0. I\u2019m observing patterns along certain diagonals in how 6 appears in the outputs. For example, column 3 alters across rows 1 to 3, while column 6 changes in rows 3 and 4. I\u2019ll chart these coordinates systematically to see if there's a consistent pattern. Let's keep digging into these transformations!**Applying the Coloring Rule**\n\nI\u2019m outlining the rule for coloring in this puzzle. Columns divisible by 3\u2014specifically indices 0, 3, and 6\u2014are special. I\u2019ll recolor any non-zero cell in these columns to a value of 6, while other cells remain unchanged. For the provided test input, I'll loop through each of these special columns, checking their values and applying the rule. \n\nThe final output grid transforms correctly to show adjusted values based on this checking process. It looks consistent, and I can present each row line by line!",
