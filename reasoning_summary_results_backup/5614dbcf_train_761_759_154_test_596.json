I\u2019m considering evaluating the block as a 3x3 section and perhaps using the median value for more accuracy. For block (0,0), when sorted, the median emerges as 9, which aligns with the output discrepancies I've been observing.**Exploring block outputs**\n\nI\u2019m examining the values in block (0,1), where sorting reveals a median of 5, but the output is 0\u2014so that\u2019s odd. I\u2019m considering if the special sum of central blocks or a convolution might be influencing this. Analyzing a 6x6 input reveals consistent outputs, but it seems we're toggling between using mode and minority values for outputs in different blocks. Wondering why block (0,1) outputs 0 despite having a mode of 5 while block (1,0) has a different approach adds to my curiosity.**Defining color rules for blocks**\n\nI\u2019m setting a rule to output the unique color in each non-overlapping 3x3 block, excluding the color 5. If a block contains primarily 5s, I wonder what to do. But so far, I haven\u2019t encountered an all-5 block. For a given 9x9 input, I\u2019m breaking it down into 3x3 sections and checking the colors. I note that I can exclude 5s and return the unique color found, yielding a final output grid of 166, 160, and 067. I'll ensure it matches expectation without extras.",
