    "reasoning": "**Analyzing mapping in digit grids**\n\nI'm looking at an ARC-like puzzle with grids of digits for input and output pairs. The goal is to understand how each input cell transforms to its corresponding output cell based on a specific mapping. Starting with the first training example, we have a 6x5 grid. I'll index the rows and columns and check for patterns, focusing on digits 3 and 5 in the input and their transformations to outputs ranging from 2 to 8. Let's note the positions of digit '3' in this first instance.**Exploring grid patterns**\n\nI'm noticing a pattern with the inputs and outputs where input 9s appear at specific coordinates, and the outputs seem linked to their proximity. It seems like cell values are determined by distances from these points, possibly through a process similar to convolution. However, the outputs aren't perfectly symmetrical; for example, cells near one input yield different results, raising questions about whether they're contributing together. I need to explore if the output represents the nearest special index or a summation of distances. It\u2019s complex, but I\u2019m intrigued by these patterns!**Mapping cross patterns for digits**\n\nI'm examining how to draw crosses around each '9' in the grid, keeping the '9' in the center while replacing neighbors with specific numbers like 2, 6, 8, and 7. I'm trying to figure out overlaps; if a cell is a neighbor to two '9s,' I'll need to handle potential conflicts in output values. It seems like there might be no overlapping '9s' based on the data. When checking patterns around '3s', they follow a similar mapping but with their specific neighbors. The rule is to maintain the original value at the special cell while using fixed values for its neighbors. I'll keep an eye on possible overlaps that could arise!",
