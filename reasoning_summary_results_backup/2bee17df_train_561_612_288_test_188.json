This happens in specific rows where 0s are flanked by the other digits. In the second example, the same pattern applies to the digit 1 surrounded by 7s, changing rows of 7111115 to 7333335. The rule seems to involve identifying blocks of certain digits that form a rectangular region and replacing them accordingly. This creates a clear transformation pattern I want to keep exploring!**Identifying replaceable regions**\n\nI'm analyzing a number grid where a specific region of digits is determined by flanking border numbers. In my example, the interior digit, which is a 7, gets replaced with a 3, while the border digits remain unchanged. I see that the rows not part of this region stay the same. The goal is to identify these blocks where the target digit, 7, is contiguous and flanked accordingly, ensuring that only rows fully matching this pattern are altered. This helps clarify which digits can be changed and how!**Analyzing number regions**\n\nI\u2019m examining a grid where certain digits form rectangles, particularly focusing on the number 7 in one example. The rows that contain this digit create a rectangular area that gets modified. The border remains intact, but the interior filled with 3s. I'm noticing how each rectangular region is defined by full runs of the target digit, which is replaced throughout these runs. \n\nIn a second example, I'm identifying another series of rectangles formed by 4s, selecting only the longest contiguous segments to change. It seems the pattern hinges on the most frequent horizontal runs within these defined shapes!",
