    "reasoning": "**Working through rotations**\n\nI\u2019m figuring out how to apply a 180\u00b0 rotation to a grid. To achieve this, I need to mirror the grid both horizontally and vertically. It involves reversing each row left-to-right and then reversing the order of the rows.\n\nFor example, I have a grid with 10 rows and 8 columns. After applying the 180\u00b0 rotation, I'll take the last row and reverse it for the first output row. Like with row 10, \"56954145\" becomes \"54149565\" when reversed.**Finalizing output format**\n\nI\u2019ve generated the rotated grid, which looks like this:\n\n54145965  \n55455155  \n45514555  \n45465956  \n45555445  \n51595445  \n55545545  \n55555455  \n55449455  \n55545565  \n\nNow, it\u2019s crucial to decide if I need to include spaces or just present the raw output. The task specifies to provide the output exactly like the example: without quotes and with each row on a new line. So, I\u2019ll keep it simple with just these 10 lines!",
