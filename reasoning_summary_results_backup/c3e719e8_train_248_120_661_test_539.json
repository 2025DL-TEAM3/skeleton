It\u2019s unexpected that there are no zeros at all. This makes me curious whether zeros only appear when there's more than one distinct digit. It seems zeros might represent a third color that isn\u2019t present in the input, illustrating an interesting deeper rule about color representation in the patterns.**Analyzing tiling patterns**\n\nI'm hypothesizing that the pattern involves creating a diagonally symmetric tiling of the input across a square grid based on the number of distinct values. So, if there are k distinct colors, it should be kxk. However, in examples, it seems the dimensions differ, like a 3x2 grid for one input while the output is a 9x4 grid. I'm noticing a pattern where the output dimensions relate closely to the input's dimensions squared, but sometimes zeros can appear, complicating the tiling arrangement. I'm curious about how these zeros fit in!**Deciphering the tiling rule**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the potential patterns in creating a grid based on input values. It seems like the rule is to tile the input into a larger grid, with dimensions being the squares of the original size. I notice zeros fill spaces depending on whether the row or column index matches specific conditions, especially the top-left value of the input. For example, in recent tests, filled positions occur when the input matches that element, while others default to zeros. This creates a structured reproduction of the original input's values.**Constructing the output grid**\n\nI'm partitioning a 4x4 grid into four 2x2 tiles. For tile(0,0), I copy the input values: \n\n- Row0: 6, 1\n- Row1: 4, 6\n\nIn tile(0,1), I replace values with zeros:\n\n- Row0: 0, 0\n- Row1: 0, 0\n\nTile(1,0) is also zeros:\n\n- Rows2: 0, 0\n- Rows3: 0, 0\n\nFinally, tile(1,1) gets the values back:\n\n- Row2: 6, 1\n- Row3: 4, 6\n\nThe output concatenates each row, resulting in:\n\n```\n6100\n4600\n0061\n0046\n``` \n\nThat's the answer!",
