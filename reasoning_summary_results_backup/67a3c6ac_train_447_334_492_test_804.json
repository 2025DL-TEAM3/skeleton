    "reasoning": "**Exploring transformation rules**\n\nI need to analyze the transformation from input examples to their outputs, starting with the first one. The input is a combination of numbers laid out in rows, and it seems like the outputs might be the result of some kind of rotation or manipulation of these numbers. For instance, looking at the first row, I can see that the input \"0 6 3 6 8 6\" changes to \"6 8 6 3 6 0.\" It feels like a careful rotation, but I need to verify this with other rows and ensure that the pattern holds consistently across the examples.**Confirming reversal patterns**\n\nIt looks like I've confirmed that the outputs are simply the inputs reversed. For example, when I reverse the first row \"0 6 3 6 8 6,\" I get \"6 8 6 3 6 0,\" which matches the output. I can see that this pattern holds for every row across both examples. I'm also ensuring that the process is consistent for each row: reversing each of them horizontally leads to the corresponding outputs without issue. So the rule seems to be mirroring each row accurately!**Finalizing row reversals**\n\nI see that the output for example three is also obtained by reversing the digits in each row. For instance, \"5 1\" becomes \"1 5.\" Following this understanding, I'll apply the same logic to the new input. \n\nWhen I reverse each of the pairs in the final input, I get:\nRow 1: \"8 8\" stays \"88.\" \nRow 2: \"7 8\" becomes \"87.\"\nRow 3: \"9 8\" becomes \"89.\"\nRow 4: \"1 6\" becomes \"61,\" and so forth, keeping the leading zeros. \n\nSo the final output neatly becomes:\n\n88\n87\n89\n61\n88\n84\n05\n23 \n\nI'll make sure to follow the formatting closely!",
