    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit mapping**\n\nI\u2019m looking at a task where we have to map a grid of digits to another grid of the same size. For example, in the first input, digits like 6 change to 2, while 5 and 9 remain unchanged. I see that row by row, we can track how each digit transforms. \n\nIn the first row, every 6 becomes 2, while 9 stays as 9 and 5 remains unchanged. It\u2019s all matching up correctly as I analyze each row!**Reassessing digit mappings**\n\nI'm analyzing the mappings between input and output digits across examples. In example 3, the mapping is consistent, with 5 mapping to 2, 6 staying 6, and 3 staying 3. For instance, in example 1, 9 stays 9, while 6 changes to 2 and 5 remains 5. \n\nBut in example 2, 4 sometimes maps to 2 and sometimes to 3 depending on its position. I'm noticing that the mapping isn\u2019t uniform like in the other examples, which adds an interesting layer of complexity!**Examining background color mapping**\n\nI see that regions of 4s are mapping to colors like 2 and 3, which makes sense if they are grouped based on adjacency. In example 2, the background 4s could be divided by the shapes, where adjacent areas might change to shape colors. But the output suggests a different approach; shapes likely retain their colors while some background regions get altered. \n\nI'm trying to determine the connectivity of background cells and how they influence the coloring process. It feels like there\u2019s a lot of complexity here!",
