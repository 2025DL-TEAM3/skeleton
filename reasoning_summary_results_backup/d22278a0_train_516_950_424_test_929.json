    "reasoning": "**Analyzing rotational patterns**\n\nI\u2019m exploring the patterns of two blocks. The first block has a symmetric pattern with zeros in the center, while the second is different\u2014maybe rotated? I\u2019m considering rotating a base 3x3 pattern by 270\u00b0 and checking if it aligns. \n\nI confirm my calculations for the rotation and see that the rotated pattern matches the structure of multiplying the base by a digit. So, it seems like this second block might indeed be a rotated version of the first pattern!**Identifying block patterns**\n\nI realize that the 5-block is actually the original pattern A. Looking at the 5-block shows it matches A perfectly. For the 7-block, I see it corresponds to a rotated version, pattern B. Checking the input seed for 7, it does cover the right rows and columns and fits pattern B.\n\nMoving to the 1-block, it seems to be a 180\u00b0 rotation of pattern A. I\u2019m seeing a rule emerging: each colored cell\u2019s pattern rotates 90\u00b0 clockwise around the grid with defined placements for each seed.**Defining seed pattern rules**\n\nI\u2019m confirming a rule: for each colored cell (seed), I should draw a 3x3 pattern around it, rotating based on its position. The seeds are located at three corners. However, I\u2019m noticing the output for the top-left block doesn\u2019t match my expectations, suggesting perhaps the background color acts as a seed instead.\n\nIt seems like the grid is actually composed of overlapping patterns, not just isolated blocks. For each seed, I need to define its position as one of the corners of its respective pattern, ensuring consistency with grid boundaries.",
