    "reasoning": "**Mapping distances for positions**\n\nI'm trying to figure out the relationship between vertical distance and horizontal radius. At vertical distance 2, the radius seems to conflict with previous findings. For one row, it looks like the horizontal radius should be 2, but they only mark positions at col3 and col7. \n\nI think I'm noticing that, in between the special positions, there are rows where I can apply a kind of \u201cflood fill\u201d technique from each special until they meet in the middle. Let\u2019s see how that pans out!**Analyzing filling patterns**\n\nI'm examining how the 2's, starting at (1,4), will expand downwards while also filling horizontally. Eventually, they'll meet the 8's expanding upwards, creating a region filled according to the nearest neighbor rule. For the 2's, I'm seeing a breadth-first search pattern where each layer fills progressively. \n\nThere seems to be a diamond shape forming due to the way they spread, managing to fill horizontally across rows efficiently. It looks like both 2's and 8's create a thick connecting path that gradually widens, leading to a symmetric filling pattern by the end!**Exploring diamond shapes and filling**\n\nI'm figuring out the structure of the diamond shapes formed by the 2's and 8's, starting from their respective positions. It appears that they expand symmetrically, with the region between them being five rows apart. As I analyze their widths at different depths, I see that the maximum width occurs closer to the middle and decreases as I move away. \n\nThe filling pattern I\u2019m identifying involves a breadth-first search from both 2 and 8, with each cell assigned based on proximity to the seed. This is like a flood fill where cells get labeled with the number that is closer, reflecting a dynamic interaction between the two shapes!",
