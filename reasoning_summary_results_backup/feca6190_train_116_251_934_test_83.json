Starting from '4', we see the first line displays '5' at position 3, then they sequentially shift left. Each shift maintains the length of four, suggesting they might be using a moving window. This means they are essentially omitting digits outside the window while capturing '5' and '4' at different positions. Fascinating how they\u2019re working with positions, right?**Exploring contiguous subarrays**\n\nI'm considering how to analyze an infinite row with '54' in it and the contiguous subarrays of length 4. If I visualize zeros on both sides, placing '54' in a sequence of length 6 means I need to look at the window length, which appears to be double the input length. For example, the input '54' leads to a window of length 4, while '904' gives a length of 6. This consistency shows I'll output a matrix, likely placing the string diagonally.",
