    "reasoning": "**Analyzing digit patterns**\n\nI'm tasked with finding irregular patterns in a grid of digits where most are 6s, but others include 1, 2, 3, and 7. I'll start by examining each row carefully, noting positions of the different digits. \n\nFor example, row 2 has a 7 at position (2,4). In row 3, I notice multiple digits including a 7 and others that will need to be replaced or shifted. It looks like the output changes some digits to 6s again, so there\u2019s a transformation happening. I wonder how they\u2019re determining these shifts!**Examining row transformations**\n\nI see that the output shows 66662366, where 2 is in column 5 and 3 in column 6. Originally, there was a 3 in column 7, which has now moved left to column 6, and a 7 has been removed. \n\nLooking at row 4, the output 66663666 seems to involve moving a 3 up from row 5, even though row 4 was originally all 6s. It feels like anomalies are shifted up or centered across rows, and maybe they\u2019re being arranged to keep exactly two anomalies per row. I wonder if there\u2019s a rotation or flipping pattern happening here?**Understanding cluster placements**\n\nI\u2019m analyzing how clusters are organized within the rows. It appears that values organized below the median are placed within the first three rows, while higher values occupy different rows. The examples show a consistent pattern where clusters occupy three contiguous rows, such as rows 1-3 or 4-6, with some rows left empty.\n\nIt seems like there's a specific method to how clusters are assigned based on color and magnitude. I noticed overlaps among clusters, which might complicate placement rules. The clusters consistently use three-column widths, tightly arranged, with specific offsets depending on the grid dimensions.",
