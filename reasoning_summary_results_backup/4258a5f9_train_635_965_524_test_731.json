There are three training blocks, and I'll analyze each one. In Block 1, it seems the digits are being modified selectively, especially the '5's. Block 2 involves more complexity with several rows. In Block 3, I start to see some consistency in how digits change. Now, I need to figure out how to apply this understanding to the test input grid.**Examining Block 2 and 3 transformations**\n\nIn Block 2, I see specific input and output transformations for a set of 9 rows. The digits seem to follow a pattern where '8' can be changed to '1' and '2' remains '2'. In Block 3, I'm analyzing the rule that defines these transformations. For the row with digits like '8' and '0', it appears not all '8's transform the same way, which complicates things. This suggests a more nuanced mapping based on position rather than a straightforward rule. I need to clarify how the patterns apply across different blocks.**Exploring transformation rules**\n\nIn Block 3, I'm observing a pattern where the central column remains unchanged, specifically keeping '8's in place while changing others to '1'. Zeroes stay zero. For Block 2, it appears all '8's transform to '1's, regardless of position. In Block 1, '5's and '9's show a similar transformation, but only central columns may retain their original digit. It seems the central color influences these transformations, possibly based on the distance or connection to certain shapes or components. I'll need to analyze these connections for a clearer understanding.**Finalizing output grid**\n\nI've settled on the final output grid: \n\n1117  \n9911  \n1919  \n\nI double-checked the second row, fourth column's original value of 7. Since it has a neighboring value of 9 in the third row, it's correctly transformed to 1. It's important to note that the background color remains unchanged if not adjacent, so that keeps the original 7 in the grid. Ultimately, I've confirmed that the transformation rules follow consistently across all blocks. I'm ready to present the final answer grid now!",
