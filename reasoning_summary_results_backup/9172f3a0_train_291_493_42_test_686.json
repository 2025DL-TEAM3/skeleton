With the given input of '00', it seems to represent a single row of two zeros. I interpret this as 1x2, which leads to an output of 3x6, using 3x3 blocks of zeros.\n\nSo the output would be three rows of 000000. But I wonder if the input could also represent two rows of single zeros.**Clarifying output format**\n\nI realize the format is a bit ambiguous since examples show each row printed on separate lines. However, with '00' presented alone, I interpret that as one row. Based on my earlier calculations, the output would indeed consist of three rows of six zeros each. \n\nTo be clear, the final output should just be:\n\n000000  \n000000  \n000000  \n\nI\u2019ll ensure that no extra text is included.",
