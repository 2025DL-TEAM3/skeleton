    "reasoning": "**Understanding patterns in data**\n\nI'm noticing that \"8808888\" has only one '0' in column 3, which is an isolated single cell. The shape includes many singles that aren't necessarily contiguous. It seems like they crop the shape that is not uniform. The '0' pattern and the symmetric pattern of '3' in row 10 might be seen as noise. The alternate rule suggests removing rows or columns that are uniformly colored until no more uniform edges exist. I\u2019ll test this on the provided example.**Analyzing bounding box and colors**\n\nI'm evaluating the non-background colors, which include '7' and '0'. It looks like the bounding box for non-background (cells not equal to '2') covers rows 1-4 and columns 1-7. Even though row 1 has two '2's in columns 5 and 6, there's a '0' at (1,7), indicating it's part of the non-background. \n\nI wonder if the background is based on a color that fills entire rows. Rows 5-7 are entirely '2', pointing to that as the background color. Zeros in the lower rows might form patterns, but the main background seems to be consistent outside shapes. I think the bounding box captures the unique color that forms a contiguous rectangular region, as seen with '5' in example 2.**Determining bounding box and output**\n\nI think the bounding box of '5' likely covers rows 1-9 and columns 1-8 since it nearly appears everywhere except one row. So, the calculated area is 72 (9 times 8). After verifying, '5' is indeed prevalent throughout; therefore, the bounding box is full. \n\nThe minimal bounding box for '9' has an area of 8. When cropping to rows 8 and 9 and columns 1 to 4, the output becomes \"9595\" from row 8 and \"5559\" from row 9, forming an output grid without spaces:\n\n```\n9595\n5559\n```",
